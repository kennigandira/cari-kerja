Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Frontend Developer (Games) position at Starcube Co., Ltd. With 8+ years of frontend engineering experience specializing in JavaScript/TypeScript and performance optimization, I am excited to transition my technical expertise into interactive game development using Cocos Creator.

While my background is in web application development, my experience aligns closely with the core technical requirements for game development. At AccelByte, I developed tools for AAA game developers, gaining valuable exposure to the gaming industry's technical standards and performance requirements. This experience, combined with my strong JavaScript foundation and optimization expertise, positions me well to contribute effectively to your game development team.

My technical achievements demonstrate the performance-focused mindset essential for game development. At 99.co, I reduced page load time from 4.5s to 1.2s through systematic optimization - the same principles apply to ensuring smooth 60fps gameplay. At PropertyScout, I contributed to improvements that increased user traffic by 27%, demonstrating my ability to build engaging, responsive experiences. At AccelByte, I achieved a 40% reduction in compilation time through developer tooling improvements, showing my commitment to workflow efficiency.

I am particularly drawn to Starcube because of the opportunity to work with Cocos Creator and apply my JavaScript expertise in a new creative domain. My experience converting complex requirements into technical specifications, optimizing performance across devices, and following clean code practices will enable me to contribute to robust, high-performance games from day one. I am eager to learn game-specific development patterns while bringing my proven optimization skills to your team.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my frontend engineering background and passion for performance optimization can contribute to creating exceptional gaming experiences at Starcube.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to speaking with you about this exciting opportunity.

Best regards,
Kenni Gandira Alamsyah
