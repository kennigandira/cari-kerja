## Why Game Development?

My experience optimizing JavaScript performance, managing complex state systems, and ensuring smooth rendering across devices provides a foundation for transitioning to game development. At AccelByte, I developed tools for AAA game developers, gaining exposure to the gaming industry's technical requirements and performance standards. While I'm new to game development specifically, I'm eager to apply my proven performance optimization expertise and JavaScript skills to learning Cocos Creator and creating engaging interactive experiences. I bring the same performance-first mindset that contributed to significant load time improvements, and I'm committed to mastering game-specific development patterns.
