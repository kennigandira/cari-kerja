Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Frontend Developer (Games) position at Starcube Co., Ltd. With 8+ years of frontend engineering experience specializing in JavaScript/TypeScript and performance optimization, I am eager to channel my technical expertise into creating engaging interactive game experiences using Cocos Creator.

My background in high-performance web application development directly aligns with game development's core technical demands. At AccelByte, I developed SDKs and developer tools for AAA game developers, gaining valuable exposure to the gaming industry's exacting technical standards and performance requirements. This experience, combined with my proven JavaScript mastery and optimization expertise, positions me to contribute immediately to your game development team.

My technical achievements reflect the performance-first mindset essential for delivering smooth gameplay. At 99.co, I achieved a 73% improvement in page load time (4.5s to 1.2s) through systematic optimization - the same performance principles that ensure consistent 60fps gameplay. At PropertyScout, I drove improvements delivering a 27% increase in user traffic, demonstrating my ability to build engaging, responsive experiences that users love. At AccelByte, I delivered a 40% reduction in compilation time through developer tooling enhancements, showcasing my commitment to workflow efficiency that benefits entire teams.

I am particularly drawn to Starcube because of the opportunity to apply my JavaScript expertise with Cocos Creator in a creative, interactive domain. My experience translating complex requirements into technical specifications, optimizing performance across devices, and implementing clean code practices will enable me to contribute to robust, high-performance games from day one.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my frontend engineering expertise and passion for performance optimization can contribute to creating exceptional gaming experiences at Starcube.
