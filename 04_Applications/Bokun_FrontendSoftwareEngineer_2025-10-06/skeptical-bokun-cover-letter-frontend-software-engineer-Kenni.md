# Cover Letter: Front-end Software Engineer at Bókun

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the Front-end Software Engineer position at Bókun. With 8+ years of specialized React and TypeScript experience, I am eager to contribute to building innovative booking management solutions for the tours and activities industry.

Your emphasis on creating intuitive, user-friendly interfaces aligns well with my background. At PropertyScout, I contributed to a web application revamp that resulted in a 27% increase in user traffic, demonstrating my ability to help create solutions that improve user engagement. At AccelByte, I worked on standardizing developer experience and contributed to a 40% compilation time reduction, showing my commitment to both user-facing experiences and engineering productivity. At 99.co, I helped improve Core Web Vitals performance—reducing LCP from 4.5s to 1.2s—the type of performance optimization work that is critical for responsive booking interfaces.

My technical background aligns with Bókun's modern stack. I have extensive experience with TypeScript and React, along with hands-on work using Tailwind CSS, Next.js, and various state management solutions. I have established component documentation using Storybook at multiple companies and regularly collaborate with designers and product managers to transform requirements into functional interfaces. My frontend engineering experience at Tiket.com—a travel booking platform—provides relevant context for the technical and user experience considerations in the travel technology space.

I am particularly drawn to Bókun's mission to empower tour operators with better technology. Beyond the professional opportunity, I am interested in Iceland's innovative culture and collaborative tech community. The opportunity to contribute to Bókun's growth within the Tripadvisor ecosystem, while experiencing Iceland's unique environment, represents an ideal career move. I believe my performance optimization skills, design sensibility, and focus on creating practical user experiences would allow me to contribute meaningfully to your team.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in building user-centric web applications can support Bókun's continued success.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to speaking with you about this opportunity.

Best regards,
Kenni Gandira Alamsyah
