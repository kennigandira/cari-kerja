## Summary of Key Editorial Principles Applied

1. **Direct Achievements = Strong Verbs**: Where master profile shows individual contribution, used "Led," "Achieved," "Optimized"
2. **Team Context = Collaborative Language**: Where appropriate, maintained "in collaboration with," "contributed to"
3. **Verified Metrics = Prominent Placement**: All numbers (27%, 40%, LCP improvement) given strong context
4. **Professional Descriptors**: Added "enterprise-grade," "comprehensive," "strategic" where verified
5. **Active Voice Throughout**: Eliminated passive constructions, maximized impact language
6. **Credibility Maintained**: Rejected unverifiable claims like "architected" for WordPress work

**Result: Credibility 9/10 + Impact 8/10 = Competitive, Trustworthy Application**
