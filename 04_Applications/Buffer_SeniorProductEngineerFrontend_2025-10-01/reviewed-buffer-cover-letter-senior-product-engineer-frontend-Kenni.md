# Cover Letter - Buffer Senior Product Engineer (Frontend)

Dear Buffer Hiring Team,

I am excited to apply for the Senior Product Engineer (Frontend) position on Buffer's Value-Led Growth team. With 8+ years of experience building high-performance React applications and contributing to measurable user growth, I am drawn to Buffer's unique culture of transparency, 4-day workweeks, and product-minded engineering.

What excites me most about this role is the opportunity to work on growth features that help users discover Buffer's value. At PropertyScout, I contributed to a web application revamp that resulted in a 27% increase in user traffic in Q3. I helped improve LCP from 4.5s to 1.2s through Core Web Vitals optimization work at 99.co, which enhanced overall site performance. These experiences taught me that meaningful growth comes from obsessing over user experience and making data-driven decisions.

Your tech stack aligns perfectly with my expertise. I have deep experience with React, TypeScript, and GraphQL (Apollo Client), and have successfully implemented comprehensive testing strategies using Jest and React Testing Library. At AccelByte, I contributed to developer experience improvements that achieved a 40% reduction in compilation time, and I helped build Storybook component libraries that became a single source of truth for UI components. I am comfortable working independently in remote environments, having worked remotely at AccelByte and collaborated with distributed teams throughout my career.

I am particularly drawn to Buffer's commitment to work-life balance and continuous learning. The 4-day workweek philosophy and growth mindset fund resonate deeply with my values. I believe the best engineering happens when teams are energized, curious, and given space to think deeply about problems.

I would love to discuss how my experience building scalable, performant web applications and my passion for product-minded engineering can contribute to Buffer's continued growth.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
