# Cover Letter - Buffer Senior Product Engineer (Frontend)

Dear Buffer Hiring Team,

I am excited to apply for the Senior Product Engineer (Frontend) position on Buffer's Value-Led Growth team. With 8+ years of experience building high-performance React applications and a proven track record of driving measurable user growth, I am drawn to Buffer's unique culture of transparency, 4-day workweeks, and product-minded engineering.

What excites me most about this role is the opportunity to work on growth features that help users discover Buffer's value. At PropertyScout, I contributed to a 27% increase in user traffic through systematic performance optimization and experimentation. I improved LCP from 4.5s to 1.2s and implemented efficient code-splitting strategies that directly impacted user engagement. These experiences taught me that meaningful growth comes from obsessing over user experience and making data-driven decisions.

Your tech stack aligns perfectly with my expertise. I have deep experience with React, TypeScript, and GraphQL (Apollo Client), and have successfully implemented comprehensive testing strategies using Jest and React Testing Library. At AccelByte, I reduced compilation time by 40% by establishing better developer experience standards, and I built Storybook component libraries that became the single source of truth for UI components. I am comfortable working independently in remote environments, having collaborated successfully with distributed teams for over 5 years.

I am particularly drawn to Buffer's commitment to work-life balance and continuous learning. The 4-day workweek philosophy and growth mindset fund resonate deeply with my values. I believe the best engineering happens when teams are energized, curious, and given space to think deeply about problems.

I would love to discuss how my experience building scalable, performant web applications and my passion for product-minded engineering can contribute to Buffer's continued growth.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
