Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Front-End Software Engineer position at KAYAK. With 8+ years of experience building scalable web applications in React and TypeScript, including previous work at Tiket.com in the travel industry, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to a platform that helps millions of travelers find the best deals.

My background aligns closely with KAYAK's needs. At PropertyScout, I revamped web applications that increased user traffic by 27%, demonstrating my ability to deliver features that drive real user engagement. At 99.co, I reduced Largest Contentful Paint from 4.5s to 1.2s through performance optimization—work that directly translates to KAYAK's need for fast, responsive user experiences. My experience at AccelByte showed my capability for architectural decision-making, where I reduced compilation time by 40% and established code quality standards using Storybook.

I have extensive experience with the technologies in your stack—React, TypeScript, CSS/SCSS, and comprehensive testing using Jest, Cypress, and React Testing Library. Having worked at Tiket.com, I understand the unique challenges of building travel platforms at scale and the importance of reliable, well-tested features.

I am particularly drawn to KAYAK's focus on end-to-end ownership and code quality, values that have driven my career. I am open to relocating to Berlin and excited about contributing to a product used by millions of travelers worldwide.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my experience in performance optimization and scalable frontend architecture can contribute to KAYAK's continued success.

Best regards,
Kenni Gandira Alamsyah
