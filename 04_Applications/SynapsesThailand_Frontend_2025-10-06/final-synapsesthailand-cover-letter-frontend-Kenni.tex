Dear Hiring Manager,

\vspace{0.3cm}

I am excited to apply for the Frontend Developer position at Synapses Thailand. With 8+ years of delivering high-impact React applications across real estate, gaming, and travel industries, I bring proven expertise in building intuitive, visually compelling user interfaces that drive measurable business results.

\noindent
\textbf{Why I'm an excellent fit:}

\vspace{0.3cm}

Your requirements align perfectly with my core strengths. At PropertyScout, I delivered a comprehensive application revamp that drove a 27\% increase in user traffic, working closely with UI/UX designers to transform Figma designs into polished, high-performance React components. My experience architecting backend APIs and optimizing frontend systems directly matches your needs for API integration expertise and performance-focused development.

\vspace{0.3cm}

My performance optimization track record demonstrates my commitment to exceptional user experiences. At 99.co, I achieved a 73\% improvement in load times by reducing LCP from 4.5s to 1.2sâ€”work that earned me the company's "Own It" Quarterly Award. At AccelByte, I achieved a 40\% reduction in compilation time, significantly improving developer experience. These achievements reflect my ability to deliver the fast, reliable applications Synapses Thailand values.

\vspace{0.3cm}

I am particularly drawn to your focus on beautiful, user-friendly interfaces and the opportunity to work on mobile applications. My React Native experience and collaborative approach to design partnerships align perfectly with your emphasis on teamwork and continuous learning. I bring not just technical expertise, but a positive attitude, strong English communication skills, and genuine passion for creating exceptional digital experiences.

\vspace{0.3cm}

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in building scalable, performant web applications can contribute to Synapses Thailand's continued success and help deliver outstanding solutions for your clients.
