# Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Frontend Developer role at Synapses Thailand. With 8+ years of experience specializing in React and modern web technologies, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to building intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces for your web-based applications.

**Why I'm a great fit:**

Your position perfectly aligns with my expertise in React development and UI/UX collaboration. At PropertyScout, I worked closely with design teams to transform Figma designs into functional web elements, contributing to a 27% increase in user traffic through our application revamp. My experience integrating backend APIs and optimizing frontend performance directly matches your requirements for API integration and performance maintenance.

My track record in performance optimization demonstrates my commitment to delivering fast, reliable applications. At 99.co, I improved Core Web Vitals by reducing LCP from 4.5s to 1.2s, and at AccelByte, I achieved a 40% reduction in compilation time through build optimization. These experiences have equipped me with the skills needed to maintain and optimize frontend systems for speed and reliability as outlined in your requirements.

I am particularly drawn to Synapses Thailand's focus on creating beautiful, user-friendly interfaces and the opportunity to potentially work on mobile applications. My experience with React Native and my collaborative approach to working with design teams align well with your emphasis on teamwork and continuous learning. I bring a positive attitude, strong English communication skills, and a passion for delivering exceptional user experiences.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in building scalable, performant web applications can contribute to Synapses Thailand's continued success.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to speaking with you about this exciting opportunity.

Best regards,

Kenni Gandira Alamsyah
