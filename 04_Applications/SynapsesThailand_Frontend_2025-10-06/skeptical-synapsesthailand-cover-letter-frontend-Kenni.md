# Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the Frontend Developer position at Synapses Thailand. With 8+ years of building React applications across real estate, gaming, and travel industries, I bring strong experience in creating intuitive, visually compelling user interfaces that contribute to business results.

**Why I'm a strong fit:**

Your requirements align well with my core strengths. At PropertyScout, I contributed to a comprehensive application revamp that helped achieve a 27% increase in user traffic, working closely with UI/UX designers to transform Figma designs into polished, high-performance React components. My experience integrating backend APIs and optimizing frontend systems directly matches your needs for API integration expertise and performance-focused development.

My performance optimization experience demonstrates my commitment to quality user experiences. At 99.co, I helped improve load times by reducing LCP from 4.5s to 1.2sâ€”work that earned me the company's "Own It" Quarterly Award for product ownership. At AccelByte, I contributed to a 40% reduction in compilation time. These achievements reflect my ability to contribute to fast, reliable applications.

I am particularly drawn to your focus on beautiful, user-friendly interfaces and the opportunity to work on mobile applications. My React Native experience and collaborative approach to design partnerships align well with your emphasis on teamwork and continuous learning. I bring technical expertise, a positive attitude, strong English communication skills, and genuine passion for creating quality digital experiences.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in building scalable, performant web applications can contribute to Synapses Thailand's continued success and help deliver outstanding solutions for your clients.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to exploring this opportunity with you.

Best regards,

Kenni Gandira Alamsyah
