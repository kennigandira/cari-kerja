# Cover Letter - Frontend Developer Position at Baldur Connect

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Frontend Developer (JS/TypeScript) position at Baldur Connect. With 8+ years of experience as a Frontend Engineer specializing in JavaScript, TypeScript, and React, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to digitizing communication in traditional industries and supporting your mission to serve major European banks and energy providers.

**Why I'm a great fit for Baldur Connect:**

Your focus on digitizing traditional industries strongly resonates with my experience. At PropertyScout, I contributed to transforming the real estate industry by revamping web applications that resulted in a 27% increase in user traffic. Similarly, at 99.co, I worked on modernizing property platforms, improving Core Web Vitals and reducing LCP from 4.5s to 1.2s. This experience in digitizing traditional sectors like real estate directly aligns with your work in banking and energy industries.

My technical expertise matches your requirements perfectly. I have extensive experience with JavaScript and TypeScript (8+ years), React ecosystem development, and modern containerization practices including Docker. Having worked remotely for international companies and across different countries (Thailand, Indonesia), I bring strong collaboration skills essential for your diverse, 30+ nationality team environment. My experience with Agile/Scrum methodologies, code reviews, and pair programming at companies like AccelByte and PropertyScout demonstrates my ability to thrive in collaborative development environments.

I am particularly drawn to Baldur Connect's commitment to employee growth through your Software Engineering Training Academy and your international, family-friendly workplace culture. The opportunity to relocate to Stuttgart and contribute to serving 1500+ customers across major European institutions is incredibly appealing. My international work experience and current English proficiency, combined with my willingness to improve my German language skills, position me well for this role.

The 40% reduction in compilation time I achieved at AccelByte through build optimization and my consistent track record of performance improvements demonstrate my ability to contribute to your continuous integration and refactoring initiatives from day one.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in building scalable, performant web applications for traditional industries can contribute to Baldur Connect's continued success in digitizing communication across European markets.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to speaking with you about this exciting opportunity.

Best regards,
Kenni Gandira Alamsyah
