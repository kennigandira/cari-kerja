Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Web Engineer position at Zscaler. With 8+ years of experience building high-performance web applications using React, Node.js, and modern CMS platforms, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Zscaler's mission of enabling secure digital transformation for enterprises worldwide.

Your focus on web engineering excellence and collaborative innovation resonates deeply with my professional journey. I bring proven expertise in the technologies central to this role—React, Node.js, and PHP—combined with extensive CMS experience across WordPress, Strapi, and OctoberCMS. While my Drupal exposure is growing, my track record of rapidly mastering new platforms (Vue 3 migration at AccelByte, custom Strapi implementation at PropertyScout) demonstrates my ability to quickly become productive with enterprise CMS systems.

My web engineering achievements include improving Core Web Vitals metrics (LCP from 4.5s to 1.2s), reducing JavaScript bundle sizes by 60%, and contributing to a 27% increase in organic traffic through technical optimization. At AccelByte, I worked across global teams spanning US, Singapore, and Poland time zones, implementing CI/CD pipelines with GitLab—directly applicable to Zscaler's distributed engineering culture.

I am particularly drawn to Zscaler's commitment to web architecture best practices and automation frameworks. My experience establishing component libraries with Storybook, implementing accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA), and optimizing build processes aligns perfectly with your need for engineering excellence and scalable solutions.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in building performant, accessible web applications can contribute to Zscaler's continued success.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to speaking with you about this exciting opportunity.

Best regards,
Kenni Gandira Alamsyah
