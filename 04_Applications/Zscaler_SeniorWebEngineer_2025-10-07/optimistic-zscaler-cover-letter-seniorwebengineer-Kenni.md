Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Senior Web Engineer position at Zscaler. With 8+ years of architecting high-performance web applications using React, Node.js, and enterprise CMS platforms, I am energized by the opportunity to contribute to Zscaler's mission of enabling secure digital transformation for enterprises worldwide.

Zscaler's commitment to web engineering excellence and collaborative innovation aligns perfectly with my professional journey. I bring proven expertise in the core technologies for this role—React, Node.js, and PHP—combined with extensive CMS architecture experience across WordPress (5+ years), Strapi, and OctoberCMS. My track record demonstrates rapid platform mastery: I successfully led a Vue 3 migration at AccelByte and architected custom Strapi implementations at PropertyScout, showcasing my ability to quickly become productive with new enterprise CMS systems like Drupal.

My web engineering achievements speak to measurable impact: I optimized Core Web Vitals reducing LCP from 4.5s to 1.2s, achieved 60% JavaScript bundle size reduction, and contributed to a 27% increase in organic traffic through technical optimization and SEO leadership. At AccelByte, I collaborated across global teams spanning US, Singapore, and Poland time zones while implementing CI/CD pipelines with GitLab—directly applicable to Zscaler's distributed engineering culture.

I am particularly drawn to Zscaler's focus on web architecture best practices and automation frameworks. My experience establishing component libraries with Storybook, implementing accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA), and optimizing build processes (40% compilation time reduction) demonstrates the engineering excellence and scalable thinking required for this role.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in architecting performant, accessible web applications can contribute to Zscaler's continued innovation and growth.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to exploring this exciting opportunity with your team.

Best regards,
Kenni Gandira Alamsyah
