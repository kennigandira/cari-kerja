Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Senior Web Engineer position at Zscaler. With 8+ years developing high-performance web applications using React, Node.js, and CMS platforms, I am energized by the opportunity to contribute to Zscaler's mission of enabling secure digital transformation for enterprises worldwide.

Zscaler's commitment to web engineering excellence and collaborative innovation aligns perfectly with my professional journey. I bring strong expertise in the core technologies for this role—React, Node.js, and PHP—combined with extensive CMS development experience across WordPress (5+ years), Strapi, and OctoberCMS. My track record demonstrates ability to quickly learn new platforms: I successfully contributed to a Vue 3 migration at AccelByte and implemented custom Strapi solutions at PropertyScout, showcasing my adaptability to new technologies and CMS systems.

My web engineering contributions include measurable impact: I improved Core Web Vitals reducing LCP from 4.5s to 1.2s, and contributed to a 27% increase in organic traffic through technical optimization and SEO implementation. At AccelByte, I collaborated across global teams spanning US, Singapore, and Poland time zones while helping implement CI/CD pipelines with GitLab—directly applicable to Zscaler's distributed engineering culture.

I am particularly drawn to Zscaler's focus on web architecture best practices and automation frameworks. My experience helping establish component libraries with Storybook, implementing accessibility standards, and contributing to build process optimization (40% compilation time reduction) demonstrates the engineering discipline and scalable thinking this role requires.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background developing performant, accessible web applications can contribute to Zscaler's continued innovation and growth.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to exploring this exciting opportunity with your team.

Best regards,
Kenni Gandira Alamsyah
