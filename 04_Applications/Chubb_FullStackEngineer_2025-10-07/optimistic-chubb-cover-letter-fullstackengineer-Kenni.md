I also spearheaded a web application modernization initiative that drove a 27% increase in user traffic (Q3).

- At 99.co, I delivered exceptional performance improvements, reducing Largest Contentful Paint from 4.5s to 1.2s (73% improvement), directly enhancing user experience and engagement.

My extensive experience with TypeScript, Node.js, and modern frontend frameworks (React, Vue.js, with transferable skills to Angular) positions me well to contribute immediately to your Digital Claims platform. I thrive in Agile environments and have proven success collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality solutions. My problem-solving approach combines technical expertise with a focus on user experience, ensuring applications are both performant and intuitive.

I am particularly excited about the opportunity to work on insurance technology that makes a tangible difference in people's lives during critical moments. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my background in building scalable, performant web applications can contribute to Chubb's continued innovation in digital claims.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to speaking with you about this exciting opportunity.

Best regards,
