# Cover Letter - Full Stack Engineer at Chubb

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Full Stack Engineer position at Chubb. With 8+ years of experience building scalable web applications across the entire technology stack, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Chubb's innovative Digital Claims solutions and help revolutionize claims handling in the digital era.

Your focus on delivering cutting-edge Digital Claims solutions through the Chubb Studio platform resonates strongly with my passion for creating user-centric applications that solve real-world problems. I am particularly drawn to this role's emphasis on full-stack development using modern technologies like TypeScript, NodeJS, and Angular to build robust applications that enhance client experiences.

Throughout my career, I have consistently delivered measurable impact through full-stack development:

- At PropertyScout, I architected end-to-end features using TypeScript, React, and Node.js, reducing API response times by 40% through backend optimization and efficient database design
- At AccelByte, I standardized developer experience across the engineering team, achieving a 40% reduction in compilation time through tooling improvements
- At 99.co, I improved Core Web Vitals performance, reducing LCP from 4.5s to 1.2s, directly enhancing user experience

My experience with TypeScript, Node.js, and modern frontend frameworks (React, Vue.js, with transferable skills to Angular) positions me well to contribute immediately to your Digital Claims platform. I thrive in Agile environments and have extensive experience collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality solutions. My problem-solving approach combines technical expertise with a focus on user experience, ensuring applications are both performant and intuitive.

I am particularly excited about the opportunity to work on insurance technology that makes a tangible difference in people's lives during critical moments. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my background in building scalable, performant web applications can contribute to Chubb's continued innovation in digital claims.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to speaking with you about this exciting opportunity.

Best regards,

Kenni Gandira Alamsyah
