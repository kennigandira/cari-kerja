# Cover Letter - Full Stack Engineer at Chubb

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Full Stack Engineer position at Chubb. With 8+ years of experience building scalable web applications across the entire technology stack, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Chubb's Digital Claims solutions and help improve claims handling in the digital era.

Your focus on delivering Digital Claims solutions through the Chubb Studio platform resonates with my passion for creating user-centric applications that solve real-world problems. I am particularly drawn to this role's emphasis on full-stack development using modern technologies like TypeScript and NodeJS to build applications that enhance client experiences during critical moments.

Throughout my career, I have contributed to measurable improvements through full-stack development:

- At PropertyScout, I developed features using TypeScript, React, and Node.js, contributing to backend optimization and database design improvements. I also helped revamp web applications, which resulted in a 27% increase in user traffic (Q3).
- At AccelByte, I contributed to developer experience standardization across the engineering team, helping achieve a 40% reduction in compilation time through build optimization and tooling improvements.
- At 99.co, I improved site performance by reducing Largest Contentful Paint from 4.5s to 1.2s, directly enhancing user experience and engagement.

My experience with TypeScript, Node.js, and modern frontend frameworks (React, Vue.js, with transferable skills to Angular) positions me well to contribute to your Digital Claims platform. I work effectively in Agile environments and have a track record of collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver quality solutions. My approach combines technical skills with a focus on user experience, ensuring applications are both performant and intuitive.

I am excited about the opportunity to work on insurance technology that makes a tangible difference in people's lives during critical moments. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my background in building scalable, performant web applications can contribute to Chubb's digital claims innovation.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to speaking with you about this opportunity.

Best regards,

Kenni Gandira Alamsyah
