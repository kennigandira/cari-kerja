# Cover Letter - Frontend Developer at SII Poland

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Frontend Developer position at SII Poland. With 8+ years of experience building high-performance web applications using React, TypeScript, and modern JavaScript frameworks, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to SII's expansion in Thailand and support your mission of delivering innovative technology consulting solutions.

SII's commitment to building multithreaded, distributed software systems for enterprise clients aligns perfectly with my experience in developing scalable, performance-optimized applications. At PropertyScout, I contributed to a web application revamp that resulted in a 27% increase in user traffic through performance enhancements and improved user experience. At AccelByte, I optimized build processes for AAA game development tools, reducing compilation time by 40% and significantly improving developer productivity. At 99.co, I improved Core Web Vitals by reducing LCP from 4.5s to 1.2s through code splitting and optimization techniques.

My expertise in React (8+ years), TypeScript, and collaborative Scrum environments makes me well-suited for this role. I have extensive experience integrating frontend applications with backend services using RESTful APIs and GraphQL, conducting comprehensive testing and debugging with Jest and Cypress, and delivering high-quality code through rigorous code reviews and continuous improvement practices. Having worked remotely and in cross-functional teams across multiple companies, I understand the importance of clear communication and knowledge sharing in distributed environments.

I am particularly drawn to SII Poland's focus on technology consulting and digital transformation. My background in optimizing developer experience, establishing coding standards, and mentoring team members aligns with your need for engineers who can contribute to both technical excellence and team collaboration.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience in building scalable, performant web applications can support SII Poland's growth in the Thai market and contribute to your clients' success.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to speaking with you about this exciting opportunity.

Best regards,
