# Cover Letter - Agoda Frontend Engineer

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Software Engineer, Front End role at Agoda. With 8+ years of experience as a Frontend Engineer specializing in React and TypeScript, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Agoda's mission of connecting travelers with 4.7M hotels and properties worldwide.

**Why I'm passionate about Agoda:**

Having spent significant time at Tiket.com, Indonesia's leading online travel platform, I understand the unique challenges of building performant, user-friendly interfaces for millions of travelers. Agoda's position as part of Booking Holdings and its truly global reach with 95+ nationalities across 27 markets resonates deeply with my passion for creating inclusive, accessible travel technology. Your commitment to diversity and innovation aligns perfectly with my experience working in cross-functional, international teams.

**Proven impact in travel technology:**

My track record demonstrates the kind of immediate value I can bring to Agoda:
- At PropertyScout (real estate platform in Thailand), I led a web application revamp that increased user traffic by 27% through React optimization and improved UX
- At Tiket.com, I implemented React and TypeScript solutions that handled millions of monthly bookings, directly contributing to the platform's growth
- Consistently improved Core Web Vitals across projects, including reducing page load times from 4.5s to 1.2s at 99.co

**Ready to deliver from day one:**

While this role seeks 1-2 years of experience, my 8+ years means I can provide immediate senior-level contributions during this 6-month contract. I bring deep expertise in React and TypeScript, proven ability to write clean, maintainable code, and extensive experience with Git workflows and agile methodologies. My time working with international teams has honed my English communication skills, enabling effective collaboration with Agoda's diverse workforce.

I am particularly excited about this opportunity because I'm already based in Bangkok and deeply familiar with Southeast Asian travel patterns and user expectations. My combination of technical expertise and travel industry knowledge would allow me to contribute meaningfully to Agoda's frontend initiatives from day one.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my experience building scalable travel platforms can help Agoda continue delivering exceptional experiences to travelers worldwide.

Best regards,  
Kenni Gandira Alamsyah
