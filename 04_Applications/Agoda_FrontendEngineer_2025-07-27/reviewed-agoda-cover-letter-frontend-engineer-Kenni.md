# Cover Letter - Agoda Frontend Engineer (REVIEWED)

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Software Engineer, Front End role at Agoda. As a Frontend Engineer with extensive React and TypeScript experience, I am excited about contributing to Agoda's mission of connecting travelers with accommodation worldwide.

**Why this role interests me:**

My experience at Tiket.com, one of Indonesia's online travel platforms, gave me valuable insights into the challenges of building travel technology interfaces. Agoda's global reach and diverse team of 95+ nationalities across 27 markets appeals to my interest in working within international, collaborative environments.

**Relevant experience:**

While I bring 8+ years of frontend development experience, I understand this is an entry-level position requiring 1-2 years. I am genuinely interested in this role because:
- I am seeking opportunities to work with Agoda's specific technology stack and learn from your team
- The 6-month contract aligns with my current career goals
- I am open to contributing at the level required for this position

My recent work includes:
- Contributing to a team effort that improved user traffic by 27% at PropertyScout through React-based UI enhancements
- Working on the Tiket.com platform that serves Indonesian travelers
- Participating in performance optimization initiatives that improved Core Web Vitals metrics

**What I offer:**

I bring solid experience with React and TypeScript, familiarity with Git workflows, and proven ability to work in agile teams. My experience working with international colleagues has developed my English communication skills. Being already based in Bangkok, I am immediately available and familiar with the local market.

I understand this is a junior-level position and am prepared to work within the scope and compensation structure appropriate for this role. I am eager to learn from Agoda's engineering team and contribute to your frontend development efforts.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how I can contribute to Agoda's frontend team.

Best regards,  
Kenni Gandira Alamsyah

## REVIEWER'S NOTES

### Critical Changes Made:

1. **Toned down the overqualification issue**
   - Acknowledged the experience gap directly
   - Expressed willingness to work at the appropriate level
   - Added mention of being "open to compensation structure appropriate for this role"

2. **Corrected exaggerations**
   - Removed "significant time" at Tiket.com (was only 11 months)
   - Changed "millions of monthly bookings" to "platform that serves Indonesian travelers"
   - Clarified 27% traffic increase as "team effort"
   - Removed claim of "immediate senior-level contributions"

3. **Adjusted tone**
   - Removed aggressive self-promotion
   - Added humility and learning orientation
   - Focused on what they can learn rather than what they already know

4. **Made claims more realistic**
   - Changed "led" to "contributing to"
   - Added "participating in" for optimization efforts
   - Removed ownership of platform-wide metrics

### Remaining Concerns:

1. **Why apply for junior role?** - Still not fully convincing why someone with 8 years wants an entry-level position
2. **Flight risk** - Hiring manager may worry they'll leave once they find senior role
3. **Team dynamics** - Potential issues with someone very senior in a junior role

### Recommendation:
Consider applying for more appropriate senior-level positions at Agoda instead, or be even more explicit about reasons for seeking junior role (e.g., career change, specific technology focus, work-life balance, etc.)
