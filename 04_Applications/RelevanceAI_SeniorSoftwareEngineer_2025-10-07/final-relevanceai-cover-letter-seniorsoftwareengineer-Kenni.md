Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm excited to apply for the Senior Software Engineer position at Relevance AI. With 8+ years building high-performance applications in TypeScript and Node.js, I'm eager to contribute to your mission of democratizing AI workforce automation.

Your vision to empower anyone to build AI agents resonates strongly with my experience creating developer tools that amplify team productivity. At AccelByte, I developed tools for AAA game studios and achieved a 40% reduction in compilation time through systematic optimization. At PropertyScout, I delivered a 27% user traffic increase through application modernization. At 99.co, I improved site performance by reducing LCP from 4.5s to 1.2s, demonstrating my commitment to technical excellence.

What distinguishes my approach is balancing rapid shipping with uncompromising quality standards. I thrive in fast-paced environments where innovation meets rigor—exactly what's needed to build enterprise-grade AI automation tools. My expertise with TypeScript, Node.js, and Vue.js aligns directly with your tech stack, while my track record of mentoring engineers and initiating knowledge-sharing sessions positions me to help shape your engineering culture.

I'm passionate about working at the forefront of AI innovation with a talented, nimble team. The opportunity to build tools that transform how people work—combined with solving complex problems in AI agent systems—is what drives me as an engineer.

I'm confident I can contribute meaningfully to Relevance AI's continued success and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background aligns with your team's needs.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
Kenni Gandira Alamsyah
