Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Software Engineer position at Relevance AI. With 8+ years of experience specializing in TypeScript and Node.js, combined with a passion for AI technology, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your mission of empowering anyone to delegate work to an AI workforce.

Your platform's focus on building AI agents that replicate human work resonates deeply with my experience in creating developer tools and high-performance applications. At PropertyScout, I revamped web applications resulting in a 27% increase in user traffic while maintaining rigorous code quality standards. At AccelByte, I standardized developer experiences achieving a 40% reduction in compilation time through build optimization. These experiences have prepared me to ship impactful features quickly while pushing the boundaries of what's possible with modern technology.

What excites me most about Relevance AI is the opportunity to work at the forefront of AI innovation with a nimble team. My expertise with TypeScript, Node.js, and Vue.js aligns perfectly with your tech stack, while my track record of performance optimization—including improving Core Web Vitals from 4.5s to 1.2s at 99.co—demonstrates my commitment to technical excellence. I have also initiated knowledge-sharing sessions and mentored engineers, experiences that would enable me to contribute to shaping your engineering culture.

I thrive in fast-paced startup environments where rapid iteration and high-quality delivery go hand in hand. The challenge of building enterprise-grade AI automation tools, combined with the opportunity to mentor other engineers and shape engineering processes, aligns perfectly with my career aspirations.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in building scalable, performant applications can contribute to Relevance AI's continued success in democratizing AI technology.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to speaking with you about this exciting opportunity.

Best regards,
Kenni Gandira Alamsyah
