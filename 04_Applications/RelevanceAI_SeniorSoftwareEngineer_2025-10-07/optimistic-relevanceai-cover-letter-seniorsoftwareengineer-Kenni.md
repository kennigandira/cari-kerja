Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm excited to apply for the Senior Software Engineer position at Relevance AI. With 8+ years architecting high-performance applications in TypeScript and Node.js, I'm ready to push the boundaries of AI technology and help democratize AI workforce automation.

Your mission to empower anyone to build AI agents resonates deeply with my experience creating developer tools that amplify team productivity. At AccelByte, I architected tools serving AAA game studios, achieving a 40% reduction in compilation time through systematic optimization. At PropertyScout, I drove 27% user traffic growth through comprehensive application modernization. At 99.co, I delivered a 73% performance improvement (LCP 4.5s → 1.2s), demonstrating my commitment to technical excellence at scale.

What distinguishes my approach is the combination of rapid shipping velocity and uncompromising quality standards. I thrive in fast-paced environments where innovation meets rigor—exactly the balance required to build enterprise-grade AI automation tools. My expertise with TypeScript, Node.js, and Vue.js positions me to make immediate impact on your tech stack, while my track record of mentoring engineers and pioneering knowledge-sharing initiatives prepares me to help shape your engineering culture.

I'm passionate about working at the forefront of AI innovation with a nimble, high-performance team. The opportunity to build tools that fundamentally transform how people work—combined with the challenge of solving technically sophisticated problems in AI agent systems—aligns perfectly with what drives me as an engineer.

I'm confident I can deliver impactful features within my first month and contribute meaningfully to Relevance AI's continued success in making AI technology accessible to everyone.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how I can contribute to your team's mission.

Best regards,
Kenni Gandira Alamsyah
