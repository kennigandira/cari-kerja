Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm excited to apply for the Senior Software Engineer position at Relevance AI. With 8+ years building web applications in TypeScript and Node.js, I'm eager to contribute to your mission of making AI workforce automation accessible.

Your goal to empower anyone to build AI agents resonates with my experience developing tools that improve team productivity. At AccelByte, I helped develop tools for AAA game studios and contributed to a 40% reduction in compilation time. At PropertyScout, I worked on application improvements that contributed to 27% user traffic growth. At 99.co, I helped improve site performance, reducing LCP from 4.5s to 1.2s, demonstrating my commitment to quality.

What I bring is a combination of solid technical skills and collaborative mindset. I enjoy fast-paced environments where quality matters—the kind of balance needed to build reliable AI automation tools. My experience with TypeScript, Node.js, and Vue.js would allow me to contribute to your tech stack, while my background in mentoring and knowledge-sharing could help support your engineering culture.

I'm interested in working with AI technology alongside a talented team. The opportunity to build tools that change how people work—and the challenge of solving complex problems in AI systems—is what motivates me as an engineer.

I'm confident I can contribute meaningfully to Relevance AI's continued success and growth.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how I can support your team's mission.

Best regards,
Kenni Gandira Alamsyah
