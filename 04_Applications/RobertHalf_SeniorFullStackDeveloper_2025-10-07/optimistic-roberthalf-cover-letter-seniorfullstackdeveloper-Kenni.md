# Cover Letter - Robert Half: Senior Full Stack Developer

Dear Hiring Manager,

I bring 8+ years of proven full-stack development expertise and a genuine passion for building robust backend systems that power exceptional user experiences. Your search for a TypeScript/Node.js specialist who "lives and breathes coding" resonates deeply with my engineering approach and track record of delivering measurable business impact.

At PropertyScout, I architected a full-stack web application revamp that drove a 27% increase in user traffic through strategic database design, Node.js backend services, and optimized SQL queries. I designed and implemented asynchronous data processing workflows to handle high-volume user interactions, demonstrating the backend-heavy focus and distributed systems expertise this role demands.

My experience spans the complete backend technology stack you require: Node.js/TypeScript development, relational database design and optimization, RESTful API architecture, microservices patterns, and comprehensive testing practices with Jest and Cypress. At AccelByte, I standardized developer experience infrastructure, achieving a 40% reduction in compilation time through build optimization. At 99.co, I optimized Core Web Vitals performance from 4.5s to 1.2s LCP, earning quarterly recognition for technical excellence.

I'm particularly energized by your commitment to backend infrastructure that powers critical services for Australians. The opportunity to work with a growing engineering team on scalable, distributed applications aligns perfectly with my strengths in asynchronous programming, database architecture, and technical communication. While my experience is primarily with cloud platforms generally, I'm a fast learner who thrives on mastering new technologies - I'm eager to dive deep into Azure services and contribute to your technology strategy from day one.

I'm confident my expertise in TypeScript, Node.js, SQL optimization, and distributed system design makes me a strong fit for this role. I'm available to start before Christmas and excited to contribute to your continued growth and technical excellence.

I look forward to discussing how I can add immediate value to your engineering team.

Best regards,

Kenni Gandira Alamsyah
