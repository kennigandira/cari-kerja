# Cover Letter - Robert Half: Senior Full Stack Developer

Dear Hiring Manager,

I bring 8+ years of TypeScript/JavaScript development experience with a strong frontend foundation and growing backend capabilities. While my background is primarily frontend-focused, I've been actively expanding my full-stack skills and am genuinely excited about the opportunity to deepen my backend expertise in a role that emphasizes Node.js, database design, and distributed systems.

At PropertyScout, I contributed to a web application revamp that helped drive a 27% increase in user traffic (Q3). My work involved both frontend implementation and collaboration with backend teams on Node.js services, which sparked my interest in taking on more backend-heavy responsibilities. At AccelByte, I helped standardize developer experience infrastructure, contributing to a 40% reduction in compilation time through build optimization. At 99.co, I worked on Core Web Vitals optimization that improved LCP from 4.5s to 1.2s, earning quarterly recognition for technical contributions.

My experience with your required technologies includes TypeScript/JavaScript, Node.js, RESTful API integration, and comprehensive testing with Jest and Cypress. I'm comfortable with modern development practices including Git workflows, agile methodologies, and code quality standards. However, I want to be transparent: while I have foundational experience with backend development through Node.js and API work, my database design and SQL optimization experience is limited compared to what this role likely requires. Similarly, I don't have hands-on Azure experience, though I'm a quick learner eager to master cloud platforms.

What I can offer is a strong engineering mindset, proven ability to deliver measurable results, excellent technical communication skills, and genuine enthusiasm for expanding my backend capabilities. I see this role as an opportunity to grow into a true full-stack engineer while contributing my frontend expertise to create complete, polished solutions.

I'm available to start before Christmas and would welcome the chance to discuss how my frontend strengths and growing backend skills could complement your team, with the understanding that I'll need to continue developing my backend expertise on the job.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,

Kenni Gandira Alamsyah
