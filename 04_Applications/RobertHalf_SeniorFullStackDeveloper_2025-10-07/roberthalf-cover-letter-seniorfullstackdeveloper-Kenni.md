# Cover Letter - Robert Half: Senior Full Stack Developer

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Full Stack Developer position at your IoT company through Robert Half. With 8+ years of experience building scalable web applications using TypeScript, Node.js, and modern full-stack technologies, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to a fast-growing company delivering critical services to Australians.

Your emphasis on expert software development and passion for end-to-end solutions resonates deeply with my engineering philosophy. I have built production systems across e-commerce, real estate, and fintech domains, consistently focusing on robust backend architecture, database optimization, and maintainable code. My experience with microservices, RESTful APIs, and asynchronous programming aligns well with your technical requirements.

At Property Scout, I contributed to a 27% increase in user engagement through full-stack development including PostgreSQL database design, Node.js API development, and comprehensive testing with Jest and Cypress. I implemented asynchronous data processing workflows and optimized SQL queries, reducing database response times by 40%. Through my work at multiple startups, I have developed strong expertise in TypeScript, object-oriented and functional programming patterns, and automated testing practices.

I am particularly drawn to this role because of the opportunity to work with a growing engineering team on infrastructure that powers critical services. Your commitment to flexible work arrangements, modern technology stack, and work-life balance aligns perfectly with my values. While I have not worked specifically with Azure services, I have extensive experience with cloud platforms and am a fast learner who thrives on mastering new technologies.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in TypeScript, Node.js, database design, and full-stack development can contribute to your continued growth and technical excellence.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to speaking with you about this exciting opportunity.

Best regards,

Kenni Gandira Alamsyah
