# Cover Letter - Robert Half: Senior Full Stack Developer

Dear Hiring Manager,

I bring 8+ years of TypeScript/JavaScript expertise with a proven track record of full-stack development and genuine enthusiasm for building robust backend systems. Your search for a developer who "lives and breathes coding" resonates deeply with my engineering approach and demonstrated ability to deliver measurable business impact.

At PropertyScout, I developed a full-stack web application revamp that drove a 27% increase in user traffic (Q3), working across frontend implementation and Node.js backend services. This experience deepened my interest in backend architecture and distributed systems. At AccelByte, I delivered developer experience improvements achieving a 40% reduction in compilation time through build optimization. At 99.co, I optimized Core Web Vitals performance from 4.5s to 1.2s LCP, earning quarterly recognition for technical excellence.

My experience aligns well with your core requirements: TypeScript/JavaScript development, Node.js/NestJS/Express.js backends, RESTful API implementation, comprehensive testing with Jest and Cypress, Git workflows, and agile methodologies. I've consistently demonstrated the ability to rapidly adopt new technologies and contribute meaningfully while expanding my expertise - a pattern I'm eager to continue with Azure cloud services and advanced database optimization techniques.

I'm particularly energized by the opportunity to work on backend infrastructure that powers critical services for Australians. The chance to deepen my expertise in distributed systems, database architecture, and cloud platforms while contributing to a growing engineering team aligns perfectly with my career goals and technical interests.

I'm confident my full-stack capabilities, proven learning agility, and passion for backend development make me a strong fit for this role. I'm available to start before Christmas and excited to contribute to your continued technical excellence.

I look forward to discussing how I can add value to your engineering team.

Best regards,

Kenni Gandira Alamsyah
