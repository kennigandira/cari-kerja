Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Software Engineer 1 - Frontend position at Mekari. With 8+ years of experience building scalable web applications and a track record in performance optimization, I am interested in contributing to Indonesia's leading SaaS platform serving over 1 million users.

Mekari's mission to accelerate digital transformation for Indonesian entrepreneurs aligns well with my experience in delivering impactful solutions. I have worked extensively with TypeScript and React.js to build large-scale applications across real estate, gaming, and travel industries. My experience with Vue.js, combined with proficiency in modern testing frameworks like Jest and Cypress, aligns with your technical requirements.

At PropertyScout, I contributed to web application revamps that helped achieve a 27% increase in user traffic. At AccelByte, I worked with the team to standardize developer experience, contributing to a 40% reduction in compilation time. At 99.co, I was part of performance optimization efforts that reduced LCP from 4.5s to 1.2s. These achievements reflect my ability to contribute to measurable business outcomes through technical collaboration.

I am particularly interested in Mekari's ecosystem with Jurnal, Talenta, Qontak, and Flex. The opportunity to work on products impacting thousands of businesses is compelling. My experience mentoring developers and establishing knowledge-sharing practices aligns with your emphasis on team collaboration and technical documentation.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in building performant, scalable web applications can contribute to Mekari's continued growth.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to speaking with you about this opportunity.
