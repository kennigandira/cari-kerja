Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Lead Frontend Engineer position at CSG. With 8+ years of experience building scalable web applications and contributing to technical excellence through leadership, I am eager to contribute to the CSQ Quote & Order platform and help modernize telecommunications and banking industries through innovative frontend solutions.

CSG's mission to channel "the power of all" to create extraordinary experiences resonates deeply with my engineering philosophy. Your commitment to continuous learning, technical excellence, and team empowerment aligns perfectly with my track record of improving developer experience while delivering measurable business impact. I'm particularly energized by the opportunity to balance 50% hands-on coding with technical leadership—precisely where I thrive, combining strategic thinking with hands-on implementation.

My experience contributing to performance improvements and technical initiatives demonstrates my readiness to drive impact at CSG. At PropertyScout, I contributed to a web application revamp that resulted in a 27% increase in user traffic. At AccelByte, I worked on developer experience improvements achieving a 40% reduction in compilation time (from 15 to 9 minutes), improving team productivity. At 99.co, I helped improve Core Web Vitals reducing LCP from 4.5s to 1.2s, earning the "Own It" award for product ownership and winning Best UI/UX Design at the 99 Group Hackathon in a company-wide competition.

While my expertise is in React and TypeScript ecosystems, I've successfully navigated framework transitions throughout my career—from Vue.js to React and across diverse technology stacks—demonstrating the adaptability that will accelerate my contribution to your Angular and micro-frontend architecture. My experience building component libraries, establishing Storybook documentation standards, and working with modular architectures provides a strong foundation for contributing to web components and modern frontend systems. Additionally, my experience helping to establish code conventions, mentoring engineering teams, and participating in thorough PR reviews positions me to help define UI/X development standards and support your team's technical growth.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience in performance optimization, team development, and building scalable applications can contribute to CSG's innovation in the Quote & Order platform and drive measurable impact for your customers.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
Kenni Gandira Alamsyah
