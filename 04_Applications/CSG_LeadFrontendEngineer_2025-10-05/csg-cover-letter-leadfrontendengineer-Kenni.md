Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Lead Frontend Engineer position at CSG. With 8+ years of experience building scalable web applications and leading frontend initiatives, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to the CSQ Quote & Order platform and help modernize industries like telecommunications and banking.

CSG's focus on channeling "the power of all" to create extraordinary experiences resonates deeply with my collaborative approach to engineering. Your commitment to continuous learning, technical excellence, and team empowerment aligns with my track record of improving developer experience while delivering impactful user-facing features. I'm particularly drawn to the opportunity to contribute 50% hands-on coding while driving technical directionâ€”a balance that matches my passion for both leadership and building.

My experience delivering performance optimizations and leading technical initiatives demonstrates my readiness for this role. At PropertyScout, I contributed to a 27% increase in user traffic through web application improvements. At AccelByte, I standardized developer experience achieving a 40% reduction in compilation time. At 99.co, I improved Core Web Vitals reducing LCP from 4.5s to 1.2s, earning recognition through the "Own It" award and Best UI/UX Design at the 99 Group Hackathon.

While my primary expertise is in React and TypeScript, I've successfully navigated framework transitions throughout my career, from Vue.js to React ecosystems, demonstrating adaptability that will serve well in contributing to your Angular and micro-frontend architecture. My experience with component libraries, Storybook documentation, and modular architecture provides a strong foundation for working with web components and modern frontend systems. Additionally, my background establishing code conventions, mentoring teams, and championing clean code through thorough PR reviews aligns with your need for someone who can define UI/X development standards and be a technical multiplier.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in performance optimization, team development, and building scalable applications can contribute to CSG's continued innovation in the Quote & Order platform.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
Kenni Gandira Alamsyah
