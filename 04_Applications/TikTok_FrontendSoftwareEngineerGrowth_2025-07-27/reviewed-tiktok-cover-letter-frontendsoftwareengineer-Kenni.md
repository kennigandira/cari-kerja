# Cover Letter - TikTok Frontend Software Engineer - Growth (Reviewed)

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Frontend Software Engineer - Growth role at TikTok. With 8 years of experience building frontend solutions and a track record of driving measurable user engagement improvements, I am excited to contribute to TikTok's growth initiatives.

**Why I'm a strong fit for your Growth team:**

Your focus on user acquisition and retention through data-driven approaches aligns with my experience. At PropertyScout, I contributed to a 27% increase in Q3 user traffic through frontend optimizations. At AccelByte, I reduced compilation time by 40%, improving team productivity. At 99.co, I helped reduce page load times from 4.5s to 1.2s, directly impacting user retention.

**Technical alignment:**

I bring strong proficiency in React, JavaScript, and modern frontend tools including Redux, Webpack, and Jest. I have extensive experience with testing frameworks and component documentation. While I haven't worked with Micro Frontends specifically, I've built modular, scalable applications and am eager to learn and apply new architectures.

I'm drawn to TikTok's "Always Day 1" culture and the opportunity to work on growth experiments at scale. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my frontend expertise can help drive TikTok's continued growth.

Best regards,
Kenni Gandira Alamsyah
