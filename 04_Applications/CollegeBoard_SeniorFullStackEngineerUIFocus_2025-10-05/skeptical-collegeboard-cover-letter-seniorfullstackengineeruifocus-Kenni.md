Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm excited to apply for the Senior Full-Stack Engineer (UI Focus) position on College Board's BigFuture Student team. With 8+ years building React, TypeScript, and modern UI solutions, I'm energized by your mission of supporting 7 million students annually in discovering their educational and career paths.

At PropertyScout, I contributed to a web application revamp that resulted in a 27% increase in user traffic through performance optimizations and enhanced UX. At 99.co, I helped improve site performance, reducing LCP from 4.5s to 1.2s through Core Web Vitals optimizationâ€”directly improving user engagement. These experiences showed me how technical quality creates real-world impact.

Your emphasis on mentorship and collaborative development resonates with my experience. At AccelByte, I initiated knowledge-sharing sessions and helped standardize code conventions, contributing to a 40% reduction in compilation time while supporting team growth and code quality. I've consistently participated in code reviews, Storybook documentation, and frontend best practices throughout my career.

My full-stack experience aligns with your needs. I have strong proficiency in React, TypeScript, Next.js, and Node.js, with hands-on API development using GraphQL and Express.js. I'm eager to deepen my expertise in AWS Serverless, Lambda, and DynamoDB to help build scalable solutions for students.

I developed the UPH university platform serving students and faculty, experiencing educational technology's potential firsthand. I'm excited to bring this passion, collaborative approach, and full-stack experience to help BigFuture continue supporting students in unlocking their potential.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Kenni Gandira Alamsyah
