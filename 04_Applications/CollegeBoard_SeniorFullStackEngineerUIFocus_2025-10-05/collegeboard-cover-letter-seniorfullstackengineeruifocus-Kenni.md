Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm excited to apply for the Senior Full-Stack Engineer (UI Focus) position on College Board's BigFuture Student team. With 8+ years specializing in React, TypeScript, and modern UI architectures, I'm drawn to your mission of empowering 7 million students annually to discover their educational and career paths.

At PropertyScout, I drove a web application revamp that delivered a 27% increase in user traffic through performance optimizations and enhanced UX. At 99.co, I improved Core Web Vitals, reducing LCP from 4.5s to 1.2sâ€”a 73% improvement that directly enhanced user engagement for thousands of daily visitors. These experiences taught me how technical excellence translates to real-world impact.

Your emphasis on mentorship and collaborative development resonates deeply. At AccelByte, I initiated knowledge-sharing sessions and standardized code conventions, achieving a 40% reduction in compilation time while fostering team growth. I've consistently championed code reviews, documentation with Storybook, and frontend best practices across my roles.

My full-stack experience aligns well with your needs. I have strong proficiency in React, TypeScript, Next.js, and Node.js, with hands-on API development using GraphQL and Express.js. While my AWS Serverless experience is developing, I'm eager to deepen my expertise in Lambda, DynamoDB, and cloud-native architectures.

Most importantly, I built the UPH university platform serving thousands of students, giving me firsthand experience in educational technology's transformative power. I'm excited to bring this passion and technical expertise to help BigFuture continue empowering students nationwide.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Kenni Gandira Alamsyah
