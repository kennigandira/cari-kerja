Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm excited to apply for the Senior Full-Stack Engineer (UI Focus) position on College Board's BigFuture Student team. With 8+ years architecting React, TypeScript, and modern UI solutions, I'm energized by your mission of empowering 7 million students annually to discover their educational and career paths.

At PropertyScout, I spearheaded a web application revamp that delivered a 27% increase in user traffic through strategic performance optimizations and enhanced UX. At 99.co, I achieved a 73% LCP improvement (4.5s→1.2s) through comprehensive Core Web Vitals optimization—directly boosting user engagement for thousands of daily visitors. These experiences reinforced how technical excellence creates measurable real-world impact.

Your emphasis on mentorship and collaborative development resonates deeply. At AccelByte, I launched knowledge-sharing sessions and helped standardize code conventions, contributing to a 40% reduction in compilation time while fostering team growth and engineering excellence. I've consistently championed code reviews, comprehensive Storybook documentation, and frontend best practices throughout my career.

My full-stack experience aligns closely with your needs. I bring strong proficiency in React, TypeScript, Next.js, and Node.js, with hands-on API development using GraphQL and Express.js. I'm eager to deepen my expertise in AWS Serverless, Lambda, DynamoDB, and cloud-native architectures to build scalable solutions for millions of students.

Most importantly, I developed the UPH university platform serving thousands of students, experiencing firsthand educational technology's transformative power. I'm excited to bring this passion, proven collaborative leadership, and full-stack expertise to help BigFuture continue empowering students nationwide to unlock their potential.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Kenni Gandira Alamsyah
