Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Senior Web Developer position at KnitWell Group, where I can contribute to the digital experiences that empower women through AnnTaylor.com and LOFT.com. As a Frontend Engineer with 8+ years of eCommerce experience, I have a track record of contributing to measurable business improvements through technical quality and collaboration.

My experience aligns well with your Web Production team's priorities. At 99.co, I contributed to performance improvements that reduced LCP from 4.5s to 1.2s, while implementing SEO strategies and schema validation that helped improve site traffic. This experience translates directly to optimizing promotional content and campaign pages. At PropertyScout, I worked on a web application revamp that contributed to a 27% increase in user traffic, demonstrating how technical execution can support business results. These contributions were recognized with the "Own It" award for product ownership and as part of the team that won the 99 Group Hackathon Best UI/UX Design award.

I bring the technical expertise your team requires: strong HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills; experience with modern templating frameworks; performance, accessibility, and SEO optimization knowledge; and extensive CMS platform experience with WordPress, Strapi, and OctoberCMS that transfers to Salesforce Commerce Cloud. My background includes W3C validation compliance, cross-browser compatibility testing, and close collaboration with UX designers and marketing teams to transform creative visions into functional digital experiences.

What excites me about KnitWell Group is the opportunity to contribute to brands that make a genuine difference in women's lives while working in a culture that values empowerment and giving back. The hybrid model appeals to meâ€”I enjoy collaborative environments where I can partner with producers, designers, and product managers to deliver quality customer experiences.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my performance optimization experience, collaborative approach, and business-focused mindset can support the digital experiences for Ann Taylor and LOFT customers.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to exploring this opportunity with you.

Best regards,
Kenni Gandira Alamsyah
