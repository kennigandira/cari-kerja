Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Senior Web Developer position at KnitWell Group, supporting AnnTaylor.com and LOFT.com. With 8+ years of frontend development experience in eCommerce and content-rich environments, I am drawn to your mission of empowering women through exceptional digital experiences.

My background aligns perfectly with your Web Production team's needs. At 99.co, I improved site performance by reducing LCP from 4.5s to 1.2s while implementing SEO best practices and schema validationâ€”directly applicable to optimizing promotional content across your digital channels. At PropertyScout, I revamped web applications resulting in a 27% increase in user traffic, demonstrating my ability to deliver measurable business impact through technical excellence.

I bring specific expertise that matches your requirements: advanced HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills; experience with JavaScript templating frameworks; proven ability to optimize for performance, accessibility, and SEO; and extensive CMS platform experience with WordPress, Strapi, and OctoberCMS that transfers seamlessly to Salesforce Commerce Cloud. My track record includes W3C validation compliance, cross-browser compatibility testing, and close collaboration with UX designers and marketing teams to bring creative campaigns to life.

What excites me most about KnitWell Group is the opportunity to contribute to brands that make a real difference in women's lives. Your commitment to employee empowerment and creating a culture of giving back resonates deeply with my values. I am particularly energized by the hybrid model, as I thrive in collaborative environments where I can work closely with producers, designers, and product managers.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my performance optimization expertise and collaborative approach can help deliver polished, high-performing customer experiences for Ann Taylor and LOFT.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to speaking with you about this exciting opportunity.

Best regards,
Kenni Gandira Alamsyah
