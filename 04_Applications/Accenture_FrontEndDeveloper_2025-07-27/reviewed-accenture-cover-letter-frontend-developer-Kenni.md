Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my genuine interest in the Front End Developer role at Accenture. With 8+ years of experience as a Frontend Engineer specializing in React and TypeScript, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Accenture's digital transformation initiatives and innovative client solutions.

**Why I'm a strong fit:**

I am drawn to Accenture's position as a global technology leader with 775,000+ employees driving innovation across diverse industries. Your commitment to digital transformation and inclusive workplace practices aligns well with my professional values. Having worked extensively with React and modern JavaScript frameworks across various locations including Bangkok, I understand the importance of building scalable solutions that deliver real business value.

My recent achievements demonstrate the impact I can bring to your team:
- At PropertyScout, I contributed to a web application revamp that increased user traffic by 27% in Q3 2023
- At AccelByte, I helped reduce compilation time by 40% through build tool optimization, improving developer productivity
- At 99.co, I improved Core Web Vitals performance, reducing LCP from 4.5s to 1.2s, enhancing user experience

Your requirements for React, GraphQL, REST APIs, and modern build tools (Webpack/Vite) align strongly with my expertise. I have hands-on experience with many of your preferred technologies including Material UI, Tailwind CSS, GitHub Actions, and Docker. While my primary framework expertise is in React, I am eager to expand into Vue.js and Angular as needed. My work with Figma for design collaboration and focus on accessibility standards ensures I can deliver inclusive, user-centered solutions. Additionally, my experience mentoring developers and contributing to technical initiatives positions me well for the responsibilities you've outlined.

I am interested in Accenture because of your focus on technology innovation and delivering value through diverse perspectives. My experience building high-performance applications for real estate, gaming, and travel industries has taught me to adapt quickly and deliver solutions that meet varied client needs.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in building scalable, performant web applications can contribute to Accenture's continued success in Thailand and globally.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to speaking with you about this opportunity.

Best regards,
Kenni Gandira Alamsyah
