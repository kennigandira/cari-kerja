Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the Senior Frontend Engineer - DAM position at Frontify. As a frontend engineer with 8+ years of experience in React, TypeScript, and component-driven architecture, I am interested in contributing to Frontify's mission of empowering brands like Uber, Microsoft, and Volkswagen through digital asset management solutions.

Throughout my career, I have contributed to significant improvements in web application performance and user experience. At PropertyScout, I helped revamp the web application, contributing to a 27% increase in user traffic through performance optimization. At 99.co, I improved site performance by reducing LCP from 4.5s to 1.2s through Core Web Vitals optimization, which earned recognition with the "Own It" Outstanding Performance award. These experiences have taught me the value of methodical optimization and collaborative problem-solving.

Your requirements align well with my technical background. I have extensive React and TypeScript experience across multiple production environments, having helped establish component libraries using Storybook at AccelByte where our team achieved a 40% reduction in compilation time through build optimization. I have worked with both REST and GraphQL APIs, and I am comfortable with testing frameworks including Jest, Cypress, and React Testing Library. I actively participate in code reviews, pair programming, and knowledge-sharing sessions to support team growth and maintain code quality.

The opportunity to work within Frontify's collaborative engineering culture appeals to me. I value environments where continuous improvement and technical excellence are prioritized. My experience with legacy code migration and building scalable solutions would allow me to contribute meaningfully to your DAM platform's evolution.

I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss how my experience building performant, scalable frontend applications could support Frontify's continued growth.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
Kenni Gandira Alamsyah
