Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Senior Frontend Engineer - DAM position at Frontify. As a senior frontend engineer with 8+ years of specialized expertise in React, TypeScript, and component-driven architecture, I am energized by Frontify's mission to empower brands like Uber, Microsoft, and Volkswagen through innovative digital asset management solutions.

My track record demonstrates the impact I can bring to your DAM team. At PropertyScout, I architected a web application revamp that drove a 27% increase in user traffic through strategic performance optimization. At 99.co, I transformed site performance by reducing LCP from 4.5s to 1.2s through comprehensive Core Web Vitals optimization - this earned me the "Own It" Outstanding Performance award. These achievements reflect my ability to deliver measurable business impact through technical excellence.

Your requirements align precisely with my expertise. I bring deep React and TypeScript experience across multiple production environments, having architected component libraries using Storybook at AccelByte where I achieved a 40% reduction in compilation time through build optimization. I have strong API integration experience with both REST and GraphQL, and comprehensive testing knowledge with Jest, Cypress, and React Testing Library. Beyond technical skills, I actively mentor developers through code reviews, pair programming, and knowledge-sharing sessions - establishing engineering best practices and fostering collaborative culture.

The opportunity to work within Frontify's vibrant, innovative engineering culture particularly excites me. I thrive in collaborative environments where technical excellence and continuous improvement are valued. My experience migrating legacy code while architecting scalable solutions positions me to contribute meaningfully to your DAM platform's evolution from day one.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my proven track record of building performant, scalable frontend applications can accelerate Frontify's continued success in empowering brands worldwide.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
Kenni Gandira Alamsyah
