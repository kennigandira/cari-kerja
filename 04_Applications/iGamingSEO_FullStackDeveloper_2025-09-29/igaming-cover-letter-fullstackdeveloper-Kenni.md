# Cover Letter - Full Stack Developer (SEO Platform)

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Full Stack Developer (SEO Platform) role at your iGaming company. With 8+ years of experience as a Full Stack Engineer specializing in JavaScript, Node.js, and SEO optimization, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your technically advanced SEO automation platform.

**Why I'm a great fit:**

Your proof-of-concept SEO automation platform represents exactly the type of challenge I thrive on - combining technical excellence with measurable business impact. My experience building scalable web applications across gaming, real estate, and content-heavy platforms positions me perfectly to help expand your Node.js backend and improve your HTML/JavaScript frontend for optimal SEO performance.

My track record demonstrates the impact I can bring to your SEO platform. At PropertyScout, I contributed to a web application revamp that resulted in 27% increase in user traffic through performance and SEO optimizations. At 99.co, I improved Core Web Vitals significantly, reducing LCP from 4.5s to 1.2s while implementing SEO improvements that enhanced site traffic. During my time at AccelByte, I developed tools for AAA game developers, giving me valuable insight into building robust platforms for technical users.

I excel at the specific technologies your role requires: strong JavaScript foundations, Node.js and Express.js backend development, API integrations, and file system manipulation with JSON and Markdown. My experience with headless CMS systems at multiple companies, combined with my proven SEO optimization skills, directly aligns with your needs for improving content workflows and managing article metadata. I'm particularly drawn to clean code development and have consistently maintained high standards while documenting architecture for team collaboration.

I am particularly excited about joining an iGaming company that values technical innovation. The opportunity to work on an SEO automation platform that combines my full-stack expertise with performance optimization perfectly matches my passion for building scalable solutions that deliver measurable results.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in building performant, SEO-optimized web applications can contribute to scaling your platform and achieving your business objectives.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to speaking with you about this exciting opportunity.

Best regards,
Kenni Gandira Alamsyah
