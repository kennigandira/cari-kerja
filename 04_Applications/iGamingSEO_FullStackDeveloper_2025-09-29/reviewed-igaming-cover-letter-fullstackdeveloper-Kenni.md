# Cover Letter - Full Stack Developer (SEO Platform)

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Full Stack Developer (SEO Platform) role at your iGaming company. With 8+ years of experience as a Full Stack Engineer specializing in JavaScript, Node.js, and SEO optimization, I am excited about contributing to your technically advanced SEO automation platform.

**Why I'm a great fit:**

Your proof-of-concept SEO automation platform represents exactly the type of challenge I enjoy - combining technical excellence with measurable business impact. My experience building scalable web applications across gaming, real estate, and content-heavy platforms positions me well to help expand your Node.js backend and improve your HTML/JavaScript frontend for optimal SEO performance.

My track record demonstrates the value I can bring to your SEO platform. At PropertyScout, I participated in a web application revamp that achieved a 27% increase in user traffic through performance and SEO optimizations. At 99.co, I contributed to significant Core Web Vitals improvements, helping reduce LCP from 4.5s to 1.2s while implementing SEO enhancements that improved site traffic. During my time at AccelByte, I helped develop tools for AAA game developers, giving me valuable insight into building robust platforms for technical users.

I have strong experience with the technologies your role requires: JavaScript foundations, Node.js and Express.js backend development, API integrations, and file system manipulation with JSON and Markdown. My experience with headless CMS systems at multiple companies, combined with proven SEO optimization skills, aligns well with your needs for improving content workflows and managing article metadata. I'm particularly committed to clean code development and have consistently maintained high standards while documenting architecture for team collaboration.

I am excited about joining an iGaming company that values technical innovation. The opportunity to work on an SEO automation platform that combines full-stack expertise with performance optimization matches my passion for building scalable solutions that deliver measurable results.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in building performant, SEO-optimized web applications can contribute to scaling your platform and achieving your business objectives.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to speaking with you about this opportunity.

Best regards,
Kenni Gandira Alamsyah
