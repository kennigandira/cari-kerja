# Cover Letter - Senior ReactJS Developer at SS&C Technologies

---

Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm excited to bring my 8+ years of proven track record building high-performance React applications to SS&C Technologies as your next Senior ReactJS Developer. With demonstrated results delivering measurable business impact—27% traffic growth, 73% performance improvements, and 40% developer productivity gains—I'm positioned to contribute immediately to the fintech platforms serving your 20,000+ financial services clients worldwide.

What sets me apart is my combination of technical excellence and security-first mindset developed through regulated industries. At PropertyScout, I developed solutions handling sensitive property and user data while driving significant conversion improvements. My expertise spans your entire technology stack—React, TypeScript, GraphQL, Next.js—and my focused commitment to performance optimization has consistently transformed user experience metrics. Having achieved 73% LCP improvement and driven 40% compilation time reduction, I understand how to build the scalable, performant applications that SS&C's financial platforms demand.

SS&C's mission to transform financial management resonates powerfully with my professional drive. I'm particularly drawn to the opportunity to mentor junior developers and shape technical standards—at AccelByte, I drove the developer experience standardization that significantly improved team productivity and code quality. Your emphasis on professional development and cross-functional collaboration aligns perfectly with how I work best. Based in Bangkok with immediate availability, I'm ready to contribute from day one to your team's continued success in the fintech sector.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my proven track record optimizing production React applications, combined with my compliance certifications (GDPR, AML) and security-aware development approach, can accelerate SS&C's growth in serving financial institutions.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to exploring how we can work together to build exceptional financial technology.

Best regards,
Kenni Gandira Alamsyah
