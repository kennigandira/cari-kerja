# Cover Letter - Senior ReactJS Developer at SS&C Technologies

---

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior ReactJS Developer position at SS&C Technologies. With 8+ years of specialized experience building high-performance React applications and a proven track record of delivering measurable results, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your fintech platforms that serve thousands of financial institutions worldwide.

Your mission to transform how individuals and institutions manage their finances resonates deeply with my experience in regulated industries. At PropertyScout, I contributed to a 27% increase in conversion rate through strategic frontend optimizations while maintaining strict security and compliance standards. My expertise in React, TypeScript, GraphQL, and Next.js aligns perfectly with your technology stack, and my focus on performance optimization—having improved LCP by 35% and reduced compilation time by 30%—would be valuable in building the scalable, secure applications that SS&C requires.

What excites me most about SS&C is the opportunity to work at the intersection of technology and finance, creating tools that have real impact on how organizations manage their financial operations. I am particularly drawn to the emphasis on mentorship and professional development, as I have mentored junior developers and established testing standards that improved team efficiency. Being already based in Bangkok, I am immediately available to contribute to your team's success.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in building performant, accessible web applications can support SS&C's continued growth in the fintech sector.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to speaking with you about this exciting opportunity.

Best regards,
Kenni Gandira Alamsyah
