# Cover Letter - Senior ReactJS Developer at SS&C Technologies

---

Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm excited to bring my 8+ years of experience building production React applications to SS&C Technologies as your next Senior ReactJS Developer. With a track record of contributing to measurable business impact—including 27% traffic growth, 73% performance improvements, and 40% developer productivity gains—I'm ready to help deliver the high-quality fintech platforms serving your 20,000+ financial services clients worldwide.

What sets me apart is my combination of technical expertise and collaborative approach developed across real estate, gaming, and travel industries. At PropertyScout, I've worked on solutions handling sensitive property and user data while contributing to conversion improvements. My experience spans your core technology stack—React, TypeScript, GraphQL, Next.js—and my focus on performance optimization has consistently delivered strong results. Having helped improve LCP by 73% and reduce compilation time by 40%, I understand how to build the scalable, performant applications that financial platforms demand.

SS&C's mission to transform financial management resonates with my professional goals. I'm particularly drawn to the opportunity to mentor junior developers and contribute to technical standards—at AccelByte, I helped establish developer experience practices that improved team productivity and code quality. Your emphasis on professional development and cross-functional collaboration aligns with how I work best. Based in Bangkok with immediate availability, I'm ready to contribute to your team's success from day one.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience building production React applications, combined with my compliance certifications (GDPR, AML) and awareness of secure development practices, can support SS&C's growth in serving financial institutions.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to exploring how we can work together to build exceptional financial technology.

Best regards,
Kenni Gandira Alamsyah
