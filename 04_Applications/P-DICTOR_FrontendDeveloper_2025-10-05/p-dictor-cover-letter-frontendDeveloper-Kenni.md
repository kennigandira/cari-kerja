# Cover Letter - Frontend Developer Position at P-DICTOR CO., LTD.

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Frontend Developer position at P-DICTOR CO., LTD. With 8+ years of experience building high-performance web applications using React, TypeScript, and modern JavaScript frameworks, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team in Bangkok.

P-DICTOR's focus on data visualization and performance optimization aligns perfectly with my expertise. At 99.co, I improved Core Web Vitals by reducing Largest Contentful Paint from 4.5s to 1.2s, directly impacting user experience and traffic. At PropertyScout, my web application revamp resulted in a 27% increase in user traffic in Q3. These achievements demonstrate my ability to optimize UI performance and deliver measurable results.

My technical skills closely match your requirements. I have extensive experience with React V18+ lifecycle, SPA architecture, SSR, and Redux Toolkit. I've implemented data visualization solutions using Chart.js and custom libraries, collaborated with designers to transform Figma designs into responsive components, and developed comprehensive automated testing strategies using Jest and Cypress. At AccelByte, I improved developer experience by reducing compilation time by 40% through build optimization and established component documentation standards using Storybook.

I am particularly drawn to P-DICTOR's hybrid work environment and focus on building solutions that overcome technical limitations. My experience working remotely at AccelByte and on-site at PropertyScout has made me adaptable to different work arrangements while maintaining high productivity and code quality.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in building scalable, performant web applications can contribute to P-DICTOR's continued success.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to speaking with you about this exciting opportunity.

Best regards,

**Kenni Gandira Alamsyah**
