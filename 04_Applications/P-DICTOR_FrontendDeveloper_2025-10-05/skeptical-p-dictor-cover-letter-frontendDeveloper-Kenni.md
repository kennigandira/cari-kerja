# Cover Letter - Frontend Developer Position at P-DICTOR CO., LTD.

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the Frontend Developer position at P-DICTOR CO., LTD. With 8+ years of experience building web applications using React, TypeScript, and data visualization libraries, I believe I can contribute meaningfully to your Bangkok team.

Your focus on data visualization and UI performance optimization aligns well with my experience. At 99.co, I contributed to performance improvements that reduced Largest Contentful Paint from 4.5s to 1.2s through Core Web Vitals optimization work. At PropertyScout, I helped with a web application revamp that contributed to a 27% increase in user traffic in Q3. These experiences have taught me the importance of performance and user experience in driving business results.

My technical background matches your requirements. I have strong experience with React (V18+), SPA architecture, SSR, and Redux Toolkit. I've worked on data visualization implementations using Chart.js, Apache ECharts, and custom solutions for analytics dashboards at AccelByte. My workflow includes translating Figma designs into responsive components, implementing automated testing with Jest and Cypress, and contributing to build optimizationâ€”I helped achieve a 40% reduction in compilation time through Webpack improvements and Storybook documentation.

P-DICTOR's hybrid work environment appeals to me, as I've successfully worked both remotely at AccelByte and on-site at PropertyScout while maintaining strong collaboration with my teams.

I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss how my experience building web applications with data visualization can support P-DICTOR's goals.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to speaking with you.

Best regards,

**Kenni Gandira Alamsyah**
