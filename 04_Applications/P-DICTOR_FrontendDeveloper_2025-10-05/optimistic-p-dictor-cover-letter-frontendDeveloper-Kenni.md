# Cover Letter - Frontend Developer Position at P-DICTOR CO., LTD.

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Frontend Developer position at P-DICTOR CO., LTD. With 8+ years engineering high-performance web applications using React, TypeScript, and sophisticated data visualization libraries, I am confident I can deliver immediate value to your Bangkok team.

Your focus on data visualization and UI performance optimization aligns precisely with my core expertise. At 99.co, I transformed user experience by reducing Largest Contentful Paint from 4.5s to 1.2s through comprehensive Core Web Vitals optimization, directly driving increased traffic and engagement. At PropertyScout, I architected a web application revamp that achieved a 27% increase in user traffic in Q3. These results demonstrate my ability to engineer measurable business impact through technical excellence.

My technical capabilities match your requirements perfectly. I have deep mastery of React V18+ lifecycle, SPA architecture, SSR, and Redux Toolkit state management. I've implemented production data visualization solutions using Chart.js, Apache ECharts, and custom libraries for analytics dashboards serving AAA game studios at AccelByte. My workflow includes transforming Figma designs into pixel-perfect responsive components, architecting comprehensive automated testing strategies with Jest and Cypress, and optimizing build performanceâ€”I reduced compilation time by 40% through Webpack optimization and established Storybook documentation standards.

P-DICTOR's hybrid work environment and commitment to overcoming technical limitations resonates strongly with me. My experience working remotely at AccelByte and on-site at PropertyScout has proven my adaptability while maintaining exceptional code quality and team collaboration.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my track record of building scalable, performant web applications with sophisticated data visualization can accelerate P-DICTOR's continued success.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to exploring this exciting opportunity with you.

Best regards,

**Kenni Gandira Alamsyah**
