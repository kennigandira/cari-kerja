# Cover Letter - Frontend Developer Position at P-DICTOR CO., LTD.

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Frontend Developer position at P-DICTOR CO., LTD. With 8+ years of experience building high-performance web applications using React, TypeScript, and data visualization libraries, I am confident I can contribute valuable expertise to your Bangkok team.

Your focus on data visualization and UI performance optimization aligns strongly with my background. At 99.co, I optimized site performance by reducing Largest Contentful Paint from 4.5s to 1.2s through Core Web Vitals optimization, directly improving user experience and traffic. At PropertyScout, I contributed to a web application revamp that delivered a 27% increase in user traffic in Q3. These results demonstrate my ability to deliver measurable business impact through technical execution.

My technical experience matches your requirements well. I have extensive hands-on experience with React V18+ lifecycle, SPA architecture, SSR, and Redux Toolkit state management. I've implemented data visualization solutions using Chart.js, Apache ECharts, and custom libraries for analytics dashboards serving AAA game studios at AccelByte. My workflow includes transforming Figma designs into responsive components, developing comprehensive automated testing strategies with Jest and Cypress, and optimizing build performanceâ€”I reduced compilation time by 40% through Webpack optimization and established Storybook documentation standards.

P-DICTOR's hybrid work environment resonates with me, as I've successfully worked both remotely at AccelByte and on-site at PropertyScout while maintaining strong collaboration and code quality.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience building scalable, performant web applications with data visualization can contribute to P-DICTOR's continued success.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to speaking with you about this exciting opportunity.

Best regards,

**Kenni Gandira Alamsyah**
