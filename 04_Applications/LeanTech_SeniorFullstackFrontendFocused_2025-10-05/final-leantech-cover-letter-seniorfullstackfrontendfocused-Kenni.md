# Cover Letter - Lean Tech

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Senior Fullstack Developer (Front-End Focused) position at Lean Tech. With 8+ years of experience architecting high-performance web applications and a proven track record of delivering measurable business impact, I am enthusiastic about contributing to your mission of delivering exceptional nearshore solutions to clients worldwide.

Your emphasis on Core Web Vitals optimization resonates strongly with my expertise and passion for performance engineering. At 99.co, I optimized site performance by reducing Largest Contentful Paint from 4.5s to 1.2s—a 73% improvement that enhanced organic traffic growth while maintaining industry-leading FID and CLS metrics. Combined with my WordPress development experience at Mirum Agency (custom university platform) and Hazani Rangka Utama (ThemeForest theme development), I bring directly relevant expertise for your WordPress-VIP content publishing workflow requirements.

At PropertyScout, I developed frontend features using React and TypeScript that contributed to 27% traffic growth (Q3), while collaborating closely with cross-functional teams—exactly the collaborative, results-driven approach Lean Tech values. My build tool optimization expertise (achieving 40% compilation time reduction through strategic Webpack configuration at AccelByte) and extensive experience integrating REST APIs and GraphQL demonstrate the technical depth and full-stack capabilities you're seeking.

I am particularly drawn to Lean Tech's commitment to mentorship and professional development. Throughout my career, I've been passionate about elevating team capabilities—conducting knowledge-sharing sessions at AccelByte, collaborating to establish coding standards and best practices, and helping developers grow their skills. I believe in building not just great products, but great teams, and I'm excited about contributing to Lean Tech's collaborative culture.

As someone currently thriving in remote work from Bangkok with proven experience collaborating across time zones and distributed teams, I'm well-positioned to contribute effectively to your team and deliver exceptional value to your Latin American clients from day one.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my performance optimization expertise, full-stack capabilities, and collaborative mindset can contribute to Lean Tech's continued growth and success.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
Kenni Gandira Alamsyah
