# Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm writing to apply for the Sr. React UI Developer position at SumasEdge Corporation. With 8+ years of experience building user interfaces using React.js, Redux, HTML5, CSS3, and modern JavaScript, I believe my technical background aligns well with your requirements.

**What I bring to SumasEdge:**

Throughout my career, I've focused on React development across various industries including real estate, gaming, and travel. At PropertyScout, I built responsive React components using Tailwind CSS while collaborating with designers to implement Figma designs. My experience spans Redux state management, npm package management, and build optimization with Webpack and Vite.

**Relevant experience:**

- **Performance optimization**: Contributed to improving LCP from 4.5s to 1.2s through Core Web Vitals optimization techniques at 99.co
- **Build tooling**: Helped achieve 40% compilation time reduction through build configuration improvements at AccelByte
- **Component development**: Built and documented reusable React components using Storybook across multiple projects
- **Responsive design**: Implemented cross-browser compatible interfaces across Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge

At 99.co, I contributed to performance improvements that helped increase site traffic through SEO optimization and Core Web Vitals enhancements. My remote work experience at AccelByte has prepared me to work effectively in distributed team environments while maintaining code quality and clear communication.

This contract opportunity interests me because it aligns with my React development background and allows me to contribute to your team's technical goals. I'm comfortable working independently and collaborating with remote teams to deliver quality code.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience with React.js, Redux, and responsive design could support SumasEdge's development needs.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
