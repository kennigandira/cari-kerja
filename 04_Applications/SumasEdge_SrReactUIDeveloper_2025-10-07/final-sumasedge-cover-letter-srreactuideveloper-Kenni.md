Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm excited to apply for the Sr. React UI Developer position at SumasEdge Corporation. As a React specialist with 8+ years developing high-performance user interfaces, I bring proven expertise in React.js, Redux, modern JavaScript, and responsive design—backed by measurable results.

At PropertyScout, I developed a reusable React component library with Tailwind CSS that improved team efficiency by 40% while ensuring pixel-perfect responsive design across all browsers. My experience spans the complete React ecosystem—from Redux state management to build tooling with Webpack and Vite.

**Key achievements:**
- Achieved 73% LCP improvement (4.5s → 1.2s) through Core Web Vitals optimization at 99.co
- Contributed to applications serving 500,000+ monthly users at PropertyScout and 165M+ users at Dana/Tiket.com
- Reduced compilation time by 40% through Webpack optimization at AccelByte
- Consistently deliver cross-browser compatible experiences through rigorous testing

My remote work experience at AccelByte has prepared me for autonomous contribution while maintaining effective collaboration with distributed teams. I'm confident my React expertise and track record make me a strong fit for SumasEdge. I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your team's success.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
