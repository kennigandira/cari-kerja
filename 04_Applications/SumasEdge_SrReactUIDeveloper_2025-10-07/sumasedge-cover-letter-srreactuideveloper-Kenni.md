# Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Sr. React UI Developer position at SumasEdge Corporation. With 8+ years of specialized experience building responsive, high-performance React applications, I am excited to bring my expertise in React.js, Redux, and modern frontend development to your team.

**Why I'm the right fit for this role:**

My technical background aligns perfectly with SumasEdge's requirements. I have extensive hands-on experience with React.js and Redux across multiple enterprise applications. At PropertyScout, I architected a React component library using Tailwind CSS that reduced development time by 40% while ensuring responsive, cross-browser compatible interfaces. My expertise extends to the entire modern frontend ecosystemâ€”npm package management, Webpack and Vite build tools, and performance optimization techniques that consistently achieve 95+ Core Web Vitals scores.

**Proven track record in React development:**

- At PropertyScout, I led development of React applications serving 500,000+ monthly users, implementing Redux Toolkit for complex state management
- At Dana (Indonesia's top e-wallet with 165M users), I built React dashboards and reduced bundle size by 35% through advanced Webpack optimization
- Reduced compilation time by 73% through strategic build configuration and caching strategies
- Delivered responsive interfaces tested across Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge with consistent user experiences

I'm particularly drawn to this contract opportunity because it allows me to leverage my deep React expertise in a focused, results-driven environment. My experience in remote work at AccelByte and Property Scout has honed my ability to deliver quality code independently while collaborating effectively with distributed teams.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my proven React development skills can contribute to SumasEdge's success.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
