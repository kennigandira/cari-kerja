# Cover Letter - Frontend Engineer at FurtherAI

Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm writing to apply for the Frontend Engineer - Web position at FurtherAI. With 8+ years of experience building scalable web applications using React and TypeScript, I'm interested in the opportunity to contribute to AI-powered tools for insurance professionals.

Your mission to augment human expertise with AI resonates with my experience building enterprise SaaS products. At PropertyScout, I contributed to a web application revamp that resulted in a 27% increase in user traffic. At AccelByte, I helped build developer tools for AAA game studios and contributed to a 40% reduction in compilation time while helping establish our Storybook-based component library. At 99.co, I optimized Core Web Vitals, reducing LCP from 4.5s to 1.2sâ€”a 73% performance improvement.

My technical expertise matches FurtherAI's stack: React, TypeScript, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and GraphQL. I've collaborated with designers to transform Figma specs into production-ready features and worked with design systems using Storybook. I work well in cross-functional environments, collaborating with design, product, and backend teams to ship features that balance usability, performance, and clean code.

What interests me about FurtherAI is the challenge of building AI-powered workflows for a regulated industry. My experience building data-intensive SaaS products, combined with my focus on performance and accessibility, would allow me to contribute meaningfully to your product.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background aligns with FurtherAI's needs.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,

Kenni Gandira Alamsyah
