# Cover Letter - Frontend Engineer at FurtherAI

Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm excited to apply for the Frontend Engineer - Web position at FurtherAI. With 8+ years of experience architecting scalable web applications using React and TypeScript, I'm energized by the opportunity to build AI-powered tools that transform how insurance professionals work.

Your mission to augment human expertise with AI aligns perfectly with my experience building enterprise SaaS products. At PropertyScout, I drove a 27% increase in user traffic through strategic web application improvements. At AccelByte, I built developer tools for AAA game studios and reduced compilation time by 40% while establishing our Storybook-based component library. At 99.co, I optimized Core Web Vitals, reducing LCP from 4.5s to 1.2sâ€”a 73% performance improvement.

My technical expertise directly matches FurtherAI's stack: React, TypeScript, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and GraphQL. I've partnered with designers to transform Figma specs into production-ready features and built design systems using Storybook. I excel in cross-functional environments, working with design, product, and backend teams to ship features that balance usability, performance, and clean code.

What excites me most about FurtherAI is the challenge of building AI-powered workflows for a regulated industry. Turning complex insurance processes into simple, reliable interfaces is exactly the kind of high-impact problem I thrive on. My experience building data-intensive SaaS products, combined with my focus on performance and accessibility, positions me to deliver immediate value to your product.

I'm eager to discuss how my background can accelerate FurtherAI's mission to build the future of insurance operations.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,

Kenni Gandira Alamsyah
