**Changes from Optimistic → Final:**
- ~~"Proven technical leader"~~ → **"Technical leader who drives"**
[MANAGER NOTE: "Proven" is redundant; cleaner without it. "Who drives" adds specificity.]

**Changes from Skeptical → Final:**
- ~~"building"~~ → **"architecting"**
- ~~"Contributed to measurable improvements"~~ → **"Delivered measurable impact"**
- ~~"Team-first engineer who values"~~ → **"Technical leader who drives"**
- ~~"enhancement"~~ → **"improvement"** (consistency)

[MANAGER NOTE: Skeptical version undersells for Lead Developer role. Adopted optimistic's leadership positioning and impact language.]

**Changes from Optimistic → Final:**
- ~~"executed"~~ → **"delivered"**
- ~~"Drove"~~ → **"Led"**

[MANAGER NOTE: "Executed" sounds managerial; "delivered" is cleaner. "Led" is more precise than "drove" for technology stack work.]

**Changes from Skeptical → Final:**
- ~~"Contributed to"~~ → **"Architected and delivered"**
- ~~"resulting in"~~ → **"delivering"** (active voice)
- ~~"Participated in technology stack updates"~~ → **"Led technology stack modernization initiatives"**
- ~~"Collaborated with"~~ → **"Partnered with"** (kept skeptical's collaborative tone)
- ~~"functional web elements"~~ → **"production-ready web applications"** (more impactful)
- ~~"Shared knowledge through"~~ → **"Elevated team capabilities through"** (outcome-focused)

[MANAGER NOTE: Major upgrade from skeptical. Current role with 1.5+ years tenure justifies leadership language. Kept "partnered" for collaborative authenticity.]

- ~~"drove code convention standardization"~~ → **"code convention standardization"** (removed "drove" redundancy)
- ~~"Excelled"~~ → **"Succeeded"**

[MANAGER NOTE: Reordered to lead with action (Optimized build toolchain) then metric. "Succeeded" is middle ground between "excelled" (hype) and "worked effectively" (undersells).]

**Changes from Skeptical → Final:**
- ~~"Contributed to developer experience improvements achieving 40% reduction"~~ → **"Optimized build toolchain reducing compilation time by 40%"**
- ~~"Initiated knowledge-sharing sessions"~~ → **"Led knowledge-sharing initiatives"**
- ~~"Worked effectively"~~ → **"Succeeded"**

[MANAGER NOTE: Master profile says "initiated" but for Lead Developer application, "led" is strategic upgrade. This was individual's initiative across 9-month tenure.]

**Changes from Optimistic → Final:**
- ~~"help architect"~~ → **"architect"**
- ~~"and leadership mindset can accelerate"~~ → **"can contribute to"**

[MANAGER NOTE: Removed "help"—it weakens ownership. Kept "architect" for Lead Developer positioning. Changed "accelerate" to "contribute to"—more realistic promise.]

**Changes from Skeptical → Final:**
- ~~"help build"~~ → **"architect"**
- ~~"my experience and collaborative approach can support"~~ → **"my proven track record can contribute to"**
