Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Frontend Engineer position with your AI company through HireClout. With 8+ years of experience building user-centric interfaces and developing tools for diverse users, I am eager to contribute to AI annotation workflows and model evaluation platforms.

Your mission to build interactive tools for complex annotation tasks aligns well with my experience. At PropertyScout, I developed an internal campaign management tool serving 17+ team members, enabling non-technical stakeholders to configure complex JSON structures across multiple environments. This improved technical workflows into more intuitive experiences—similar to the challenge annotation platforms face when helping teams efficiently label and evaluate AI training data.

The opportunity to ensure data integrity for large language models particularly interests me. My work on Core Web Vitals optimization—improving LCP from 4.5s to 1.2s—demonstrates the precision and quality focus that annotation workflows require. At AccelByte, I developed admin portals and tools for AAA game studios, learning to present complex data clearly to diverse audiences—a valuable skill for model evaluation interfaces.

I work well in fast-paced, autonomous environments where proactive problem-solving drives results. My contribution to a 40% compilation time reduction at AccelByte came from recognizing inefficiencies and helping implement solutions. At 99.co, my product ownership earned the Q2/21 "Own It" award and Best UI/UX Design at the 99 Group Hackathon.

I am passionate about leveraging AI advancements to solve complex challenges and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience building performant, intuitive tools can support your team's mission.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Kenni Gandira Alamsyah
