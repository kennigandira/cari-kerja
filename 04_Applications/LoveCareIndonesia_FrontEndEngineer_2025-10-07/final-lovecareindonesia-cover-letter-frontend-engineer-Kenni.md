Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Front End Engineer role at LoveCare Indonesia. With **8+ years of specialized experience** in React, Next.js, TypeScript, and React Native, I bring a proven track record of delivering measurable impact through technical excellence—and I'm eager to channel this expertise toward LoveCare's mission of transforming healthcare delivery through innovative technology.

Your requirements for building responsive web applications with React, Next.js, and React Native align perfectly with my core competencies. At PropertyScout, I **delivered a 27% increase in user traffic** through strategic web application modernization and performance optimization. At AccelByte, I **achieved a 40% reduction in compilation time** by standardizing developer workflows for AAA game studios. Most notably, at 99.co, I **optimized Core Web Vitals performance—reducing LCP from 4.5s to 1.2s** (73% improvement)—directly enhancing user experience and SEO rankings.

What excites me most about LoveCare Indonesia is the opportunity to apply my technical expertise where it matters most: improving healthcare accessibility and patient experience. My **React Native proficiency** positions me to contribute meaningfully to your mobile application development, while my expertise in **Jest and React Testing Library** ensures I'll uphold your commitment to code quality. As **winner of the 99 Group Hackathon for Best UI/UX Design**, I bring strong design sensibility that bridges the gap between beautiful interfaces and robust technical implementation—critical for healthcare applications where usability directly impacts patient outcomes.

I'm particularly drawn to joining a team that values performance optimization, accessibility standards, and collaborative development. My experience **conducting code reviews, establishing component libraries with Storybook, and leading knowledge-sharing initiatives** has prepared me to contribute to LoveCare's culture of technical excellence from day one. Additionally, my **GDPR certification and W3C accessibility compliance experience** demonstrate my commitment to security and inclusivity—essential considerations in healthcare technology.

I would be thrilled to discuss how my background in architecting scalable, performant web applications can accelerate LoveCare Indonesia's growth and enhance the healthcare experience for your users.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to your mission.

Best regards,
