# Cover Letter - Front End Developer Position
## Dexon Technology Public Company Limited

---

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Front End Developer position at Dexon Technology. With 8+ years of experience building web applications using React, Vue.js, and TypeScript, I believe I could contribute meaningfully to your team's projects.

Your requirements align well with my technical background. At PropertyScout, I contributed to a web application revamp that helped achieve a 27% traffic increase while working on Core Web Vitals optimization. At AccelByte, I was part of a team effort that reduced compilation time by 40% through build optimization. My experience at 99.co involved contributing to performance improvements that brought LCP from 4.5s to 1.2s.

I am particularly interested in Dexon Technology's focus on data visualization and 3D rendering capabilities. While I haven't yet worked directly with charting libraries or Three.js, my React and Vue.js experience, combined with knowledge of Redux, testing tools (Jest, Cypress), and responsive design principles, provides a foundation I can build upon. My track record of adapting to new technologies—from working with TypeScript at Tiket.com to building game developer tools at AccelByte—demonstrates my ability to learn quickly.

Having worked with international teams at AccelByte and currently based in Bangkok at PropertyScout, I am comfortable collaborating in English across different time zones. My commitment to code quality has been recognized through quarterly awards and hackathon recognition for UI/UX design.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience could support Dexon Technology's continued growth.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
