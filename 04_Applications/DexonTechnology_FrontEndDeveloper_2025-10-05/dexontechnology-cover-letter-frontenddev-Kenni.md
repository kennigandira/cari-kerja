# Cover Letter - Front End Developer Position
## Dexon Technology Public Company Limited

---

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Front End Developer position at Dexon Technology. With 8+ years of experience building responsive web applications using React, Vue.js, and TypeScript, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team in developing modern, high-performance user interfaces.

Your requirements for expertise in modern JavaScript frameworks, testing automation, and cross-browser solutions align perfectly with my professional experience. At PropertyScout, I revamped web applications resulting in a 27% increase in user traffic while optimizing Core Web Vitals to achieve 1.2-second page load times. At AccelByte, I reduced compilation time by 40% through build optimization and established component documentation standards using Storybook. My experience at 99.co demonstrates my commitment to performance, where I improved LCP from 4.5s to 1.2s and increased organic traffic by 87%.

I am particularly drawn to Dexon Technology's focus on data visualization and 3D rendering capabilities. While I have extensive experience with React, Vue.js, Redux, and comprehensive testing tools like Jest and Cypress, I am eager to expand my expertise in charting libraries and Three.js for your visualization projects. My track record of quickly learning new technologies—from TypeScript migration at Tiket.com to game developer tools at AccelByte—demonstrates my ability to adapt and deliver quality solutions.

Having worked with international teams at AccelByte and now residing in Bangkok at PropertyScout, I bring strong English communication skills and experience collaborating across time zones. I value code quality, maintainability, and team collaboration, as evidenced by my quarterly awards and hackathon recognition for UI/UX excellence.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in building scalable, performant web applications can contribute to Dexon Technology's continued success.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to speaking with you about this exciting opportunity.

Best regards,
