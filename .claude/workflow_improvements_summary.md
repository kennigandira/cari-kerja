# CV Workflow Improvements Summary

Based on the TikTok application experience, here are the key improvements made to the CV tailoring workflow:

## 1. Master Profile Verification
**Issue**: The system was using wrong profile data (Heryandi instead of Kenni)
**Solution**: 
- Always read master_profile.md FIRST
- Verify name consistency across all documents
- Double-check all metrics against source material

## 2. Realistic Language
**Issue**: Claims were too bold ("increased by 27%" vs "contributed to 27% increase")
**Solution**:
- Use collaborative language: "contributed to", "helped achieve", "participated in"
- Avoid taking sole credit for team achievements
- Be honest about actual scope and scale

## 3. Document Length Optimization
**Issue**: Cover letters were too long and didn't fit on one page
**Solution**:
- Enforce 300-350 word limit for cover letters
- Remove redundant sections
- Focus on 3-4 key achievements maximum

## 4. LaTeX Compatibility
**Issue**: LaTeX compilation errors with certain commands
**Solution**:
- Remove `\input{glyphtounicode}` and `\pdfgentounicode=1`
- Default to Computer Modern font for cover letters
- Test compilation before finalizing

## 5. Contact Information Updates
**Issue**: Phone number needed updating mid-process
**Solution**:
- Always verify current contact info from master profile
- Update all instances when changes are needed
- Be aware of international formats

## 6. URL Handling
**Issue**: Some job posting URLs require authentication
**Solution**:
- Handle protected URLs gracefully
- Ask user to provide job description text if URL fails
- Don't assume all URLs are accessible

## 7. Skeptical Review Enhancement
**Issue**: Initial versions contained inflated claims
**Solution**:
- Enhanced reviewer to catch fabricated metrics
- Check for inflated scope and scale exaggeration
- Ensure all claims trace back to master profile

## 8. File Organization
**Issue**: Need for additional supporting documents
**Solution**:
- Added self-introduction.md generation
- Added award description templates
- Maintain consistent naming conventions

## 9. Quality Assurance
**New Checks Added**:
- Name consistency verification
- Contact info accuracy
- Achievement accuracy against master
- Document length compliance
- LaTeX compilation success
- Professional tone maintenance

## 10. User Experience
**Improvements**:
- Clear progress tracking with TodoWrite
- Graceful error handling
- Request for user input when needed
- Maintain all versions (original and reviewed)

These improvements ensure a more reliable, accurate, and professional CV tailoring process that produces believable, ATS-optimized documents while maintaining the candidate's authentic achievements.
