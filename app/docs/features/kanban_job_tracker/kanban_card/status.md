## 🔧 Critical Bug Fixes (October 6, 2025)

During Phase 1 implementation, four critical UX issues were discovered and fixed:

### Issue #1: Modal Cannot Scroll
**Problem:** Long job descriptions caused content overflow with no way to scroll
**Root Cause:** BaseModal had `overflow-hidden` with no max-height constraint
**Fix:**
- Added `max-h-[90vh]` to modal container
- Added `overflow-y-auto` to modal body
- Implemented flex layout (`flex flex-col`) with `flex-shrink-0` on header/footer
**File:** `BaseModal.vue:74,97`

### Issue #2: Status Dropdown Not Reactive
**Problem:** Changing status in dropdown didn't update UI
**Root Cause:** Used `:value` binding instead of `v-model`
**Fix:**
- Created computed property with getter/setter
- Replaced `:value` with `v-model="currentStatus"`
**File:** `JobDetailModal.vue:81-86,285`

### Issue #3: Job Status Doesn't Match Card Column
**Problem:** Cards in "Waiting for Call" showed "To Submit" in modal
**Root Cause:** `kanban_cards.column_id` and `jobs.status` not synced
**Fix:**
- **Migration 023:** Updated `move_card_between_columns()` RPC to sync job.status
- **Migration 024:** One-time data fix for existing mismatched records
**Files:** `migrations/023_sync_job_status_on_card_move.sql`, `migrations/024_fix_existing_job_statuses.sql`

### Issue #4: Modal Layout Cramped
**Problem:** Single-column layout made long content hard to read
**Fix:**
- Implemented `grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2` responsive layout
- Left column: Match Analysis + Application Details
- Right column: Job Description
- Mobile: Stacks vertically
**File:** `JobDetailModal.vue:320`
