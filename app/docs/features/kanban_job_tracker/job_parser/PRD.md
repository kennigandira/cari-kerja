# Product Requirements Document: AI-Powered Job Parser

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 6, 2025
**Feature Owner:** Product Manager & Product Owner (Collaborative)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Approved - P0 Critical Priority
**Parent Feature:** Kanban Job Application Tracker

---

## Executive Summary

The AI-Powered Job Parser transforms job application tracking from manual data entry to automated extraction, reducing time-to-add from 5+ minutes to <30 seconds. This feature is **critical for product-market fit**, closing the competitive gap with Huntr and Teal while enabling users to scale from tracking 5 applications to 50+ without overwhelm.

### Problem
Currently, adding a job to the tracker requires:
- Manual copying of company name, position, description
- 5+ minutes per job entry
- Error-prone data entry (typos, missing fields)
- Context switching between job boards and tracker

**Pain Level: 8/10** - Blocks efficient workflow at scale (20+ applications)

### Solution
"Add Job Target" button on kanban board with two input modes:
1. **Paste job URL** ‚Üí AI scrapes + extracts ‚Üí Preview ‚Üí Confirm
2. **Paste description** ‚Üí AI extracts ‚Üí Preview ‚Üí Confirm

**AI Stack:**
- Jina AI Reader (handles JavaScript-heavy sites, returns clean markdown)
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 (superior accuracy for Bangkok/Thailand job posts)

**Fallback Strategy:**
- URL fails ‚Üí Prompt for manual paste
- Low confidence (<50) ‚Üí Require user review
- Manual paste always available as first-class option

### Impact
- ‚úÖ **Time savings:** 5 min ‚Üí <30 sec per job (90% reduction)
- ‚úÖ **Scale enablement:** Manage 50+ applications vs 10-15 currently
- ‚úÖ **Competitive parity:** Match Huntr/Teal automation features
- ‚úÖ **Data quality:** AI extracts company, position, description, salary consistently

### Target Release
- **MVP:** October 7-12, 2025 (6 days, ~24 hours effort)
- **Success Criteria:** 95%+ automated extraction rate, <30s time to add job

## üéØ PM STRATEGIC EVALUATION

### 1. Strategic Fit
**Rating: 9/10**

This feature aligns perfectly with the product vision of streamlining job search workflows. Currently, users must manually create job entries, which creates friction in the job hunting process. This "Add Job Target" button removes a significant pain point by automating job post extraction.

**User Need:**
Job seekers need to quickly capture opportunities from various job boards (LinkedIn, Indeed, company career pages) without manual data entry. The AI-powered extraction ensures consistent data quality and saves time.

**Business Impact:**
- **Reduces friction** in job capture workflow from ~5 minutes to <30 seconds
- **Increases adoption** by making the tool more competitive with alternatives like Huntr or Teal
- **Enables scale** - users can track 10x more opportunities with same effort

### 2. Market Context

**Competitor Analysis:**
- ‚úÖ **Huntr** has URL import with auto-extraction
- ‚úÖ **Teal** has browser extension for one-click save
- ‚úÖ **Simplify** has AI job description parsing
- ‚ùå **We currently lack** automated job capture

**Market Demand:** **HIGH** - This is table stakes for modern ATS/job trackers. Users expect automated data extraction.

**Opportunity Size:** **Critical for user retention.** Without this, we risk churn to competitors.

### 3. User Research

## ‚öôÔ∏è PO TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT

### 1. Technical Feasibility

**Stack Assessment:**
- ‚úÖ **Frontend:** Vue 3 + TypeScript (existing modal patterns reusable)
- ‚úÖ **Backend:** Supabase Edge Functions (can call AI APIs, Deno runtime)
- ‚úÖ **Database:** `jobs` table already has all required fields (company_name, position_title, job_description_text)
- ‚úÖ **AI Integration:** Claude API already integrated, Anthropic SDK available

**Technical Approach:**
1. **Frontend:** Reuse `JobInputModal.vue` pattern, add dropdown for input type (URL vs Paste)
2. **URL Scraping:** Supabase Edge Function ‚Üí Jina AI Reader ‚Üí Claude Sonnet 4.5 extraction
3. **Fallback:** If scraping fails (403, 404, timeout), prompt manual paste
4. **AI Extraction:** Use Claude Sonnet 4.5 to parse job post HTML/text ‚Üí structured JSON

**Blockers:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Rate limiting** on job board sites (mitigated: Jina AI handles this, manual paste fallback)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **CORS issues** (solved: server-side fetch in Edge Function)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **AI hallucination** (mitigated: confidence score, require user preview, validate company+position)

**Dependencies:**
- Jina AI Reader API (free tier, 1M tokens/month)
- Claude API credits ($3/1M input, $15/1M output - ~$1.40/month for 100 jobs)
- Supabase Edge Functions (existing infrastructure)
- No new infrastructure required

### 2. Effort Estimation

### 4. Acceptance Criteria Preview

**Story 3 (Core AI Extraction):**

**Scenario 1: Successful URL Parsing**

**Given** user pastes job posting URL (e.g., https://jobs.company.com/senior-frontend)
**When** AI successfully scrapes and parses the page
**Then** system should:
- ‚úÖ Extract company name, position title, job description
- ‚úÖ Extract optional fields: location, salary_range, job_type, posted_date
- ‚úÖ Calculate confidence score (0-100)
- ‚úÖ Show preview: "‚úÖ Found: 'Senior Frontend Engineer' at 'Airbnb'"
- ‚úÖ Display parsed data (company, position, location, salary) for user review
- ‚úÖ Provide Edit and Confirm buttons

**Scenario 2: URL Inaccessible (Fallback)**

**Given** URL is inaccessible (403, 404, timeout, CAPTCHA)
**When** scraping fails
**Then** system should:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Show fallback prompt: "Unable to access URL. Please paste job description instead."
- ‚úÖ Switch input to textarea mode automatically
- ‚úÖ Allow manual paste with same AI parsing
- ‚úÖ Continue to preview step (no data loss)

**Scenario 3: Low Confidence Extraction**

**Given** AI extracts data but confidence <50 (e.g., ambiguous job post)
**When** parsing completes
**Then** system should:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Show warning: "Extraction confidence is low. Please review carefully."
- ‚úÖ Display parsed data with editable fields
- ‚úÖ Highlight missing fields (company/position required)
- ‚úÖ Require user confirmation before save
- ‚ùå Do NOT auto-save (prevent bad data)

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Performance:** Scraping + AI parse completes in <10s (p95)
- üîí **Security:** Edge Function validates URLs (prevent SSRF attacks, check domain whitelist)
- üìä **Observability:** Log scraping failures with URL + error type for monitoring
- üí∞ **Cost:** <$0.02 per job parse (Jina AI free + Sonnet 4.5 ~$0.014/job)

### 5. PO Assessment

**Feasibility:** **Moderate** - Requires new Edge Function, but tech stack is ready

**Risk Level:** **Medium**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **AI Accuracy Risk:** Parsing might miss fields (mitigate: confidence score + user preview)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Scraping Reliability:** Job boards may block requests (mitigate: Jina AI + manual fallback)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Cost Risk:** AI API costs could scale (mitigate: Sonnet 4.5 ~$1.40/month for 100 jobs, cap at 200 jobs)

**Recommended Approach:** **Build MVP with robust fallback**
- Start with Jina AI + Claude Sonnet 4.5
- Build manual paste as first-class citizen (not afterthought)
- Iterate based on success rate analytics (target 95%+)

## ‚úÖ JOINT DECISION (PM-PO Collaboration)

### **Collaborative Discussion:**

**PM raises:**
- üö® **Urgency:** This is blocking competitive parity. Users expect this feature in modern job trackers.
- üíº **Business Case:** Without this, we can't compete with Huntr/Teal for serious job seekers.
- üéØ **Strategic Importance:** Core to product value proposition (automated job tracking).
- üìà **Growth Dependency:** Cannot scale user base without this (manual entry doesn't scale).

**PO raises:**
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Technical Complexity:** Scraping is brittle - job boards change HTML frequently.
- üí∞ **Cost Consideration:** AI API calls add ongoing costs (~$0.014 per parse with Sonnet 4.5).
- üõ°Ô∏è **Fallback Strategy:** Manual paste MUST be reliable (can't fail on edge cases).
- üîß **Maintenance:** Jina AI is external dependency (monitor uptime, have backup plan).

**Trade-Off Discussion:**
- **PM:** "Can we do URL-only in Sprint 1, add paste later?"
- **PO:** "No - fallback is critical. Too many sites block scrapers. Manual paste is MVP."
- **Agreement:** Build both in parallel. Fallback isn't optional, it's essential for 95%+ success rate.

**Cost Discussion:**
- **PM:** "Haiku is cheaper ($0.001/job). Why Sonnet 4.5 ($0.014/job)?"
- **PO:** "Bangkok/Thailand job posts need better accuracy. $1.40/month is negligible vs bad data."
- **Agreement:** Use Sonnet 4.5 for superior extraction quality. Cost difference ($1.30/month) is insignificant.

### **Final Decision:**

**‚úÖ APPROVED FOR IMMEDIATE BUILD**

**Scope:** **MVP with URL scraping (Jina AI + Sonnet 4.5) + Manual paste fallback**

**Timeline:** **Sprint 41 (Week of Oct 7-12, 2025)** - Target completion by Oct 12

**Estimated Delivery:** **October 12, 2025** (6 days from today)

**Phased Approach:**
- **Phase 1 (Oct 7):** Database migration + Edge Function (Jina AI + Sonnet 4.5)
- **Phase 2 (Oct 8):** Frontend modal (dropdown + conditional inputs)
- **Phase 3 (Oct 9):** Integration (button + card creation)
- **Phase 4 (Oct 10-12):** Testing (20 URLs) + documentation

## üí° KEY INSIGHTS

### 1. **Fallback is MVP, not optional**
Job board scraping is inherently unreliable (anti-bot measures, rate limits, CAPTCHA). Manual paste must be a first-class feature, not an afterthought. Users will rely on it 10-20% of the time.

### 2. **AI accuracy > AI speed**
Better to take 5 seconds for accurate parsing than 2 seconds for hallucinated data. Jobs are created once but referenced dozens of times (CV tailoring, match analysis). Bad data = bad decisions.

**Decision:** Use Sonnet 4.5 ($0.014/job) over Haiku ($0.001/job) for superior accuracy.

### 3. **Success metric = Data quality, not speed**
Track `% of jobs with complete data (company + position + description)` as primary KPI. Fast but incomplete parsing creates technical debt.

### 4. **Preview is mandatory, not optional**
Never auto-save AI-extracted data without user confirmation. Show preview with Edit/Confirm buttons. Trust but verify.

### 5. **Cache raw content for future improvements**
Store `raw_content` in database. If you improve the AI prompt later, you can re-parse all jobs without re-fetching URLs. This enables continuous improvement.

### 6. **Jina AI Reader is the secret weapon**
- Free tier: 1M tokens/month (~20k job posts)
- Handles JavaScript-heavy sites (LinkedIn, Greenhouse)
- Returns clean markdown (easier for AI to parse)
- No need for headless browsers or Puppeteer

**Decision:** Use Jina AI as primary method, not fallback.

**OS-1: Browser Extension**
- One-click save from LinkedIn/Indeed
- Auto-fill tracker from job board

**OS-2: Bulk Import**
- CSV upload of multiple jobs
- LinkedIn connection scraping

**OS-3: Email Integration**
- Parse job alerts from email
- Auto-import from Gmail

**OS-4: Advanced AI Features**

---

## Open Questions

**Q1: Should we cache Jina AI responses to save costs?**
- **Recommendation:** Yes, cache in `raw_content` field. Many users apply to same popular jobs (e.g., "Senior Frontend at Airbnb"). Can share parsing across users (privacy-safe, URL as cache key).

**Q2: Should we support multi-language job posts (Thai)?**
- **Recommendation:** Start with English-only prompts. Bangkok jobs are usually English or English/Thai mixed. Sonnet 4.5 handles Thai well enough. Revisit if >20% of jobs fail due to Thai-only content.

**Q3: Should we show match percentage in preview?**
- **Recommendation:** Not in MVP. Match analysis requires master profile comparison (separate step). Focus preview on data extraction accuracy first.

**Q4: Should we auto-create application folder like /cv_letsgo does?**
- **Recommendation:** Not in MVP. This is "quick add" to kanban. Full application workflow (CV generation) remains separate via /cv_letsgo command.
