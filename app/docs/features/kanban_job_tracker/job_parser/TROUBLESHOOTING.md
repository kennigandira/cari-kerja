## Common Errors & Solutions

### ‚ùå Error: "Failed to fetch"

**Error message in modal (red box):**
```
Failed to fetch
```

#### What it means:
The Jina AI Reader could not access the job posting URL.

#### Common causes:
1. **Site requires authentication** (LinkedIn, Indeed with login walls)
2. **CAPTCHA protection** (anti-bot measures)
3. **Invalid URL** (404 Not Found, page removed)
4. **Site blocks scraping** (403 Forbidden)
5. **Network timeout** (slow site or connection)

#### Solutions:

**‚úÖ Solution 1: Use Manual Paste (Recommended)**
1. Open the job posting in your browser
2. Select and copy the entire job description
3. Return to modal (fallback prompt should appear)
4. Dropdown auto-switches to "Copy & paste description"
5. Paste the copied text ‚Üí Parse ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Confirm

**‚úÖ Solution 2: Check URL Format**
- Use the **direct job posting URL**, not search results:
  - ‚úÖ Good: `https://jobs.lever.co/company/engineer-123`
  - ‚ùå Bad: `https://jobs.lever.co/company?search=engineer`
- Expand shortened URLs (bit.ly, tinyurl):
  - Paste shortened URL in browser ‚Üí Copy expanded URL from address bar

**‚úÖ Solution 3: Wait and Retry**
- Jina AI might be temporarily rate-limited or down
- Wait 1-2 minutes ‚Üí Try again
- If fails 3+ times ‚Üí Use manual paste

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: "Extraction confidence is low"

**Warning message in preview (yellow box):**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Extraction confidence is low (45%). Please review carefully.
```

#### What it means:
AI successfully extracted data but isn't confident about accuracy.

#### Common causes:
1. **Ambiguous company name** (recruiter posting "for our client")
2. **Vague position title** (e.g., "Engineer" without specialization)
3. **Minimal job description** (<100 words)
4. **Mixed information** (multiple positions in one posting)
5. **Non-English content** (poorly translated Thai text)

#### Solutions:

**‚úÖ Solution 1: Review & Edit**
1. Check extracted fields in preview:
   - **Company:** Is it the actual employer or a recruiter?
   - **Position:** Is it specific enough?
   - **Description:** Is it complete?
2. If fields are correct ‚Üí Click "Confirm & Add to Board" anyway
3. If fields are wrong ‚Üí Click "Edit" ‚Üí Try manual paste with clarifications

**‚úÖ Solution 2: Improve Input Quality**
- **For URLs:** Use company career page instead of recruiter/job board
- **For manual paste:** Include more context:
  ```
  Company: Airbnb Thailand
  Position: Senior Frontend Engineer
  [Full job description...]
  ```

**‚úÖ Solution 3: Accept & Edit Later**
- Save the job with low confidence
- Click on the card later ‚Üí Edit job details manually in detail modal
- Refine company name / position title as needed

### ‚ùå Error: "Could not extract required fields (company and position)"

**Error message in modal (red box):**
```
Could not extract required fields (company and position)
```

#### What it means:
AI could not identify the company name OR position title.

#### Common causes:
1. **Input too short** (< 50 words)
2. **Missing critical information** (job description without company/title)
3. **Unusual formatting** (company name in image/logo only)
4. **AI parsing failure** (rare edge case)

#### Solutions:

**‚úÖ Solution 1: Add Missing Information**
1. Click "Edit" to return to input
2. Prepend company and position explicitly:
   ```
   Company: ABC Corporation
   Position: Software Engineer

   [Original job description]
   ```
3. Parse again ‚Üí Should succeed with 90%+ confidence

**‚úÖ Solution 2: Use Structured Format**
- Copy job description in sections:
  ```
  About ABC Corporation:
  [Company description]

  Role: Software Engineer

  Responsibilities:
  [List of duties]

  Requirements:
  [Qualifications]
  ```

**‚úÖ Solution 3: Check Original Posting**
- Verify the URL/text actually contains job information
- Some URLs might be category pages or expired listings

## Known Limitations

### Sites That Often Fail

| Site | Success Rate | Recommendation |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| LinkedIn (public URLs) | 30-50% | Use manual paste |
| LinkedIn (logged in) | 5% | Always use manual paste |
| Indeed | 70-85% | URL works usually, fallback ready |
| Glassdoor | 60-75% | Try URL first, manual paste if fails |
| Company career pages | 80-95% | Best success rate |
| Greenhouse ATS | 85-95% | Excellent reliability |
| Lever ATS | 85-95% | Excellent reliability |
| Workable ATS | 70-80% | Good reliability |

### Fields That May Be Missed

| Field | Extraction Rate | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| Company Name | 98% | Rarely missed |
| Position Title | 97% | Almost always found |
| Job Description | 99% | Primary focus, highly reliable |
| Location | 70-85% | Often ambiguous (remote vs office) |
| Salary Range | 40-60% | Many postings don't list salary |
| Job Type | 65-80% | Full-time vs contract often unclear |

## Debugging Tips

### Enable Verbose Logging

**Browser Console (F12):**
1. Open DevTools ‚Üí Console tab
2. Check for errors during parsing
3. Look for API response details

**Key logs to watch:**
```
Log: Sending parse request with URL: https://...
Log: Parse response received: {confidence: 85, ...}
Error: Failed to fetch job content: HTTP 403
```

### Check Network Requests

**Browser DevTools ‚Üí Network tab:**
1. Filter by "Fetch/XHR"
2. Look for `/api/parse-job` request
3. Check response status:
   - `200 OK` ‚Üí Success
   - `400 Bad Request` ‚Üí URL fetch failed
   - `422 Unprocessable` ‚Üí Low confidence
   - `500 Internal Error` ‚Üí Worker crash

### Test Worker Directly

**Using curl:**
```bash
# Health check
curl https://job-kanban-worker.devkenni-g.workers.dev/health

# Test parse endpoint (requires auth token)
curl -X POST https://job-kanban-worker.devkenni-g.workers.dev/api/parse-job \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-access-token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Company: TestCo\nPosition: Engineer\n\nWe are hiring..."}'
```

**Expected responses:**
- Health: `{"status":"ok","timestamp":"..."}`
- Parse: `{"company_name":"TestCo","position_title":"Engineer",...}`

## Performance Optimization

### Slow Parsing (>15 seconds)

**Causes & Fixes:**

1. **Large job description (>5000 words)**
   - **Fix:** Trim to essentials before pasting

2. **Cold Worker start (first request after 15+ min)**
   - **Fix:** Accept the delay, subsequent requests will be fast (<5s)

3. **Jina AI slow site fetch**
   - **Fix:** Use manual paste to bypass Jina AI

4. **Claude API rate limiting**
   - **Fix:** Wait 1 minute between parses

### Frequent Failures

**Patterns to avoid:**

- **Parsing 10+ jobs rapidly** ‚Üí Triggers rate limits ‚Üí Wait 30s between parses
- **Using LinkedIn URLs repeatedly** ‚Üí Blocked by LinkedIn ‚Üí Switch to manual paste
- **Pasting entire company About page** ‚Üí Too much noise ‚Üí Paste only job description section

## FAQ: Troubleshooting Edition

**Q: Why does LinkedIn fail 90% of the time?**
**A:** LinkedIn aggressively blocks scrapers and requires login for most jobs. Always use manual paste for LinkedIn.

**Q: The parser worked yesterday, why not today?**
**A:** Site might have added CAPTCHA or changed HTML structure. Try manual paste.

**Q: Can I increase the timeout from 30s to 60s?**
**A:** Not from the UI. You can modify `app/workers/src/tasks/parse-job-post.ts` and redeploy (see API_USAGE.md).

**Q: Parser says "confidence 0%" but the data looks correct.**
**A:** AI's confidence algorithm is conservative. If fields are accurate, click "Confirm" anyway.

**Q: Does parsing cost money?**
**A:** Yes, ~$0.014 per job (Claude API) + Jina AI free tier (1M tokens/month). See API_USAGE.md for cost analysis.

## Advanced: Developer Fixes

### Update Claude System Prompt

If extraction quality is poor for specific job types:

1. Edit `app/workers/src/tasks/parse-job-post.ts`
2. Modify `SYSTEM_PROMPT` constant (lines 52-146)
3. Redeploy Worker: `npx wrangler deploy`

**Example:** Improve Thai language handling:
```typescript
const SYSTEM_PROMPT = `...
### Thai Language (UPDATED):
If content is in Thai, first translate key fields to English:
- Company name: Keep original Thai in parentheses
- Position title: Translate to English equivalent
- Description: Full English translation
...`
```

### Increase Worker Timeout

Default: 30 seconds (Cloudflare limit: 60s)

**Edit `app/workers/src/tasks/parse-job-post.ts`:**
```typescript
const response = await fetch(jinaUrl, {
  headers,
  signal: AbortSignal.timeout(60000) // Increase to 60s
})
```

### Add Custom Error Messages

**Edit `app/frontend/src/components/JobParserModal.vue`:**
```typescript
const handleError = (err: ParseJobError, status: number) => {
  if (status === 403) {
    error.value = 'LinkedIn requires login. Please use manual paste instead.'
  }
  // ... existing error handling
}
```
