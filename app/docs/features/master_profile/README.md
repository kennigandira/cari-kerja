## 🚀 Quick Start for Developers (Updated)

### 1. Understand the Feature (20 minutes)
Read in this order:
1. **[README.md](./README.md)** (this file) - Overview and status
2. **[TechnicalDiscussion.md](./TechnicalDiscussion.md)** - Consensus decisions and critical fixes
3. **[UserStories.md](./UserStories.md)** - Sprint 1 & 2 stories with acceptance criteria
4. **[ImplementationPlan.md](./ImplementationPlan.md)** - 2-week MVP timeline

### 2. Backend Development (Sprint 1, Week 1)
**Goal:** Deploy database with RPC functions

1. **Day 1-2: Deploy Migrations (6-8 hours)**
   - Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
   - Run migrations in order:
     - `004_profile_transactions.sql` (core tables + RPC functions)
     - `005_security_locking.sql` (security + soft deletes)
     - `006_indexes_export.sql` (indexes + export)
   - Verify in Table Editor
   - Test RPC functions manually

2. **Day 3: Test Security (2 hours)**
   - Test RLS policies (simulate different users)
   - Verify session-based pre-auth works
   - Check soft deletes hide data correctly

**Exit Criteria:**
- ✅ All 3 migrations deployed
- ✅ 5 RPC functions working
- ✅ RLS policies tested (no unauthorized access)

### 3. Frontend Development (Sprint 1-2, Week 1-2)
**Goal:** Build single-page form with CRUD operations

1. **Sprint 1, Day 3-5: Basic Form (6-8 hours)**
   - Read **[FrontendGuide.md](./FrontendGuide.md)** (implementation patterns)
   - Create `stores/profiles.ts` (Pinia store)
   - Create `ProfileForm.vue` (single-page form)
   - Create `useAutoSave.ts` (composable)
   - Implement create + view flows

2. **Sprint 2, Week 2: Edit + Migration (8-10 hours)**
   - Implement edit flow (reuse ProfileForm)
   - Add delete with confirmation modal
   - Create Python migration script
   - Add markdown export button
   - Test complete CRUD cycle

**Exit Criteria:**
- ✅ Can create profile in ≤ 5 minutes
- ✅ Can edit profile with optimistic locking
- ✅ Can delete profile (soft delete)
- ✅ Import from markdown works
- ✅ Export to markdown works

### 4. Before Merging (End of Sprint 2)
1. **Manual Testing Checklist** (from UserStories.md)
   - Create → View → Edit → Delete flow
   - Auto-save → Restore draft
   - Import markdown → Export markdown
   - Verify CV generation still works with exported markdown
2. **Accessibility Audit**
   - Run axe DevTools scan (0 critical issues)
   - Keyboard-only navigation test
   - Screen reader test (VoiceOver or NVDA)
3. **Security Testing**
   - Try to access other users' profiles (should fail)
   - Test concurrent edits (version conflict)
   - Verify soft deletes hide data
4. **Performance Check**
   - Form loads in < 1 second
   - Create/update in < 2 seconds
   - Test with 100+ skills (check rendering performance)
