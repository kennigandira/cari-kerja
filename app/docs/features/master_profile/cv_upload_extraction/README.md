---

## 📚 Documentation Overview

This folder contains complete documentation for the CV Upload & Extraction feature, created through collaboration between Product Owner, Product Manager, and Software Architect specialists.

**Purpose:** Allow users to upload their existing CV and have profile data automatically extracted and pre-filled, reducing manual data entry from 30 minutes to <5 minutes.

---

## 🚨 Executive Decision Summary

### **RECOMMENDATION: DEFER TO PHASE 3** ✅

**Unanimous consensus from all three specialists:**

- ✅ **Product Owner:** Need Sprint 0 spike first, 4-5 week timeline, high complexity
- ✅ **Product Manager:** ROI questionable for solo user, build only if excited about AI learning
- ✅ **Architect:** 20-30 hours complexity, must validate core workflow first

**Key Insight:** This feature is valuable for *future scenarios* (multiple profiles, team use, onboarding), but adds significant complexity before validating the core manual profile creation workflow.

- ✅ P0 blockers resolved (CB-1, CB-2, CB-3, CB-9) ← **DONE!**
- ✅ Users actively creating profiles
- ✅ Clear demand for CV upload feature

### If You're Implementing Right Now

**Follow this sequence:**
1. **Sprint 0 (1 week):** Test Claude API with 10+ real CVs ([UserStories.md](./UserStories.md))
2. **Go/No-Go Decision:** Did spike validation pass? (>80% accuracy, <30s extraction)
3. **Sprint 1 (1 week):** File upload UI ([ImplementationPlan.md](./ImplementationPlan.md) Phase 3.1)
4. **Sprint 2 (2 weeks):** AI extraction backend (Phase 3.3)
5. **Sprint 3 (3-5 days):** Polish & testing

## 💡 Specialist Insights Summary

### Product Owner Perspective
**Key Takeaway:** "This is a 4-5 week feature that needs careful planning and spike validation."

- 6 user stories across 4 epics
- Sprint 0 mandatory: Test Claude API before committing
- Story points: 22 MVP + 8 post-MVP = 30 points total
- Critical path: File upload → AI extraction → Form integration

**Quote:** *"Need comprehensive spike testing with 5+ sample CVs. Measure accuracy, time, cost before committing to full development."*

### Product Manager Perspective
**Key Takeaway:** "This isn't about saving time—it's about lowering activation energy."

- ROI Analysis: 20 min one-time savings vs 30-35 hours dev = **negative ROI**
- Strategic Value: Foundation for future AI features, data portability
- User Psychology: Reduces "why am I retyping this?" friction
- Reframe as: "Profile Kickstart" not "Time Saver"

**Quote:** *"Build it if you're excited about the learning and see this as a foundation for future AI features. Skip it if you just want to save time on a one-time setup."*

### Architect Perspective
**Key Takeaway:** "Defer to Phase 3. Complexity should follow demand, not precede it."

- Architecture: Async job queue (not synchronous Edge Function)
- Complexity: 8+ architectural problems to solve simultaneously
- Security: RLS policies, API key management, rate limiting required
- Cost: $150/month AI costs at scale (1,000 users)

**Quote:** *"The CV upload and extraction feature is architecturally feasible but strategically risky for MVP. Launch simple, learn fast, scale wisely."*

- You plan to create multiple profile variations

✅ **Technical Feasibility Test PASSED:**
- Sprint 0 spike: >80% extraction accuracy achieved
- Sprint 0 spike: <30 second extraction time
- Implementation time: <2 weeks (not worth more for solo use)

✅ **Strategic Fit Test PASSED:**
- This unblocks future features (job requirement matching, profile comparison)
- Makes product "shareable" (if others will use it)
- Excited about AI integration learning opportunity

### Don't Build This Feature If:

❌ **Opportunity Cost Test FAILED:**
- Higher-priority features exist (e.g., job tracking improvements)
- Current manual flow is "good enough" and not painful
- Solo user with infrequent profile creation

❌ **Complexity Test FAILED:**
- AI extraction requires >2 weeks to get right
- Would need to maintain multiple CV format parsers
- Team lacks AI/ML experience

❌ **ROI Test FAILED:**
- Only create master profiles once every 6 months
- 20-minute savings doesn't justify 30-35 hours build
- Budget concerns about $150/month AI costs
