## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Problem Statement

**Current Pain Point:**
Creating a master profile requires manually entering all professional information, which takes ~30 minutes. Users already have this data in their CV but must retype everything into web forms.

**User Mental Model:**
*"I already have a CV ‚Üí Why am I retyping this?"*
This creates friction at the worst moment: when users are evaluating whether to invest in the system.

### 1.2 Proposed Solution

**Feature:** CV Upload with AI-Powered Extraction

Allow users to upload their existing CV (PDF/DOCX), automatically extract profile data using AI (Claude 3.5 Sonnet), and pre-populate the profile form for review and submission.

**User Flow:**
```
Current: Click "Create Profile" ‚Üí 30 min manual entry ‚Üí Submit
Proposed: Click "Create Profile" ‚Üí Upload CV ‚Üí 5 min review/edit ‚Üí Submit
```

### 1.3 Strategic Positioning

**This is NOT a time-saver feature.**
**This is an activation barrier reducer.**

- Solo user saves 20 minutes **one time** (minimal ROI)
- Real value: Lowers "getting started" friction
- Strategic value: Foundation for future AI features (job matching, profile analysis)
- Psychological value: Transforms from "data entry tool" to "data enhancement platform"

### 1.4 Key Recommendation

**DEFER TO PHASE 3** - Build ONLY after:
1. ‚úÖ Master profile MVP launched and validated
2. ‚úÖ Users actively creating profiles
3. ‚úÖ Clear demand demonstrated through user feedback
4. ‚úÖ P0 blockers resolved (transaction integrity, optimistic locking, etc.) ‚Üê **COMPLETE**

**Why Defer:**
- 30-35 hours complexity vs 15-20 hours for entire master profile MVP
- Uncertain ROI for solo user (20 min savings vs weeks of dev)
- Should validate core workflow before adding AI complexity

---

## 2. Context & Background

### 2.1 Current System

**File-Based Workflow:**
```
01_Profile/master_profile.md (manually edited)
        ‚Üì
AI agents read for CV generation
```

**Problems:**
- 30-minute manual entry time
- Risk of typos breaking AI generation
- Single profile limitation
- No version control or audit trail

### 2.2 Target System (After Master Profile MVP)

**Database-Driven Workflow:**
```
User ‚Üí Web Form ‚Üí Supabase Database ‚Üí AI Agents
```

**This Feature Adds:**
```
User ‚Üí Upload CV ‚Üí AI Extraction ‚Üí Pre-filled Web Form ‚Üí Database
```

### 2.3 User Context

**Primary User:** Frontend Engineer, 8+ years experience, actively job searching

**Current Behavior:**
- Has existing CV in PDF/DOCX format
- Applying to 10-15 jobs per month
- Wants to customize profile for different job types (Frontend vs Full-Stack vs Leadership)

**Pain Points:**
- "I already have this information in my CV"
- "Why do I need to type everything again?"
- "What if I make a typo and break the CV generation?"

2. **Enable rapid profile variation creation** (specialized profiles per job type)
3. **Improve data accuracy** through AI parsing vs manual typing

### 3.3 Success Metrics (If Built)

**Leading Indicators (Week 1-2):**

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Measurement |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------|
| Upload adoption rate | 0% | >60% | % choosing upload vs manual |
| Upload success rate | N/A | >95% | % uploads without errors |
| Extraction accuracy | N/A | >85% | % fields correctly extracted |
| Time to completion | 30 min | <10 min | Time from upload to save |

**Lagging Indicators (Month 1-3):**

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Measurement |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------|
| User satisfaction | N/A | >4/5 | "How helpful was CV upload?" |
| Profile quality | N/A | 100% | Uploaded = manual completeness |
| Feature stickiness | N/A | >60% | % repeat usage for new profiles |
| Cost efficiency | N/A | <$0.15 | Cost per successful extraction |

## 9. Risk Assessment

### 9.1 High-Priority Risks

#### Risk 1: AI Extraction Accuracy

**Risk:** Claude API extracts wrong data (swaps job titles, hallucinates companies)

**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** High (users lose trust, revert to manual)

**Mitigation:**
- Comprehensive spike testing (Sprint 0)
- Show confidence scores for each field
- Always allow manual editing
- Quality feedback loop (Story 5)
- Start with DOCX only (easier to parse than PDF)

#### Risk 2: Cost Overruns

**Risk:** AI API costs exceed budget

**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** Medium (feature becomes unsustainable)

**Mitigation:**
- Rate limiting: 5 uploads per user per hour
- Budget alerts at $50/month in Anthropic dashboard
- Cache extraction results (same CV uploaded twice)
- Consider Claude Haiku (80% cheaper) if costs spike

#### Risk 3: PDF Parsing Failures

**Risk:** PDF extraction fails for image-based or complex layouts

**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** High (poor UX for affected users)

**Mitigation:**
- Detect image-only PDFs, show clear error
- Start with DOCX support (more reliable)
- Provide "Upload Text Version" fallback
- Future: integrate OCR (Google Cloud Vision)

### 9.2 Medium-Priority Risks

#### Risk 4: Extraction Timeout

**Risk:** Large CVs (10+ pages) exceed timeout limits

**Probability:** Low
**Impact:** Medium (user waits, then fails)

**Mitigation:**
- Set expectation: "Large CV may take up to 1 minute"
- Implement async job queue (not synchronous)
- Show progress updates during extraction

#### Risk 5: User Adoption Below Target

**Risk:** Users prefer manual entry over upload

**Probability:** Low
**Impact:** Low (feature underutilized but not harmful)

**Mitigation:**
- Phased approach validates demand before full build
- Easy to disable via feature flag if unused
- Minimal maintenance burden
