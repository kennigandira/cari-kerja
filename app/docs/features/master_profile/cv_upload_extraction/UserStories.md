## Sprint 0: Spike & Validation (1 week)

### SPIKE-1: Validate Claude API for CV Extraction

**Goal:** Determine if Claude API can reliably extract CV data before committing to full build

   - [ ] Manually compare extracted vs actual data
   - [ ] Calculate accuracy per field type:
     - Name, email, phone (should be >95%)
     - Work experience (company, title, dates) (should be >85%)
     - Skills (should be >80%)
     - Education (should be >75%)
   - [ ] Document common failure patterns

4. **Performance Testing (1 hour)**
   - [ ] Measure extraction time for each CV
   - [ ] Calculate 95th percentile latency
   - [ ] Identify timeout risks

5. **Cost Analysis (1 hour)**
   - [ ] Calculate tokens used per CV
   - [ ] Calculate cost per extraction
   - [ ] Project monthly costs for 1, 100, 1000 users
   - [ ] Set budget recommendations

**Deliverable:** Spike Report

```markdown
# Sprint 0 Spike Report: Claude API Validation

## Results Summary
- **Accuracy:** X% average across all fields
- **Extraction Time:** X seconds (95th percentile)
- **Cost:** $X per extraction
- **Failure Rate:** X% (AI timeout, parse errors)

## Go/No-Go Recommendation

- [ ] NO-GO: Critical criteria failed

## Next Steps if GO
- Proceed to Sprint 1
- Use documented prompt template
- Budget $X/month for AI costs

## Next Steps if NO-GO
- Consider alternatives (OpenAI GPT-4, manual only)
- Document why feature is not viable
```

**DoR:**

    <div v-if="isFromExtraction" class="extraction-badge">
      <span class="icon">✨</span>
      Extracted from CV (Confidence: {{ confidenceScore }}%)
      <button @click="handleStartOver">Start Over</button>
    </div>

    <ProfileForm
      :is-editing="false"
      :initial-data="extractedData"
      :confidence-scores="confidenceScores"
    />
  </div>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
import { onMounted } from 'vue';
import { useRoute } from 'vue-router';

const route = useRoute();
const isFromExtraction = ref(false);
const extractedData = ref(null);
const confidenceScores = ref({});

onMounted(async () => {
  const taskId = route.query.task_id as string;
  if (taskId) {
    // Poll for extraction result
    const result = await pollExtractionStatus(taskId);
    if (result.status === 'completed') {
      isFromExtraction.value = true;
      extractedData.value = result.extracted_data;
      confidenceScores.value = result.confidence_scores;
    }
  }
});
</script>
```

**Polling Logic:**
```typescript
// composables/useCVExtraction.ts
export function useCVExtraction() {
  async function pollExtractionStatus(taskId: string) {
    const maxAttempts = 30; // 60 seconds (2s intervals)
    let attempts = 0;

    while (attempts < maxAttempts) {
      const { data } = await supabase.functions.invoke(`cv-extraction-status/${taskId}`);

      if (data.status === 'completed' || data.status === 'failed') {
        return data;
      }

      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000)); // Wait 2s
      attempts++;
    }

    throw new Error('Extraction timeout after 60 seconds');
  }

  return { pollExtractionStatus };
}
```

**DoR Checklist:**
- [ ] Polling strategy defined (interval, timeout)
- [ ] Confidence score UI design approved
- [ ] Partial extraction handling strategy defined
- [ ] ProfileForm accepts `initialData` prop (implementation ready)

**DoD Checklist:**

- [ ] Tested with partial extraction (missing sections)
- [ ] "Start Over" button clears form correctly
- [ ] No memory leaks from polling intervals
