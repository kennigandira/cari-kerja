# Specification Quality Checklist: Master Profile Management

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-08
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)
**Status**: ✅ PASSED

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**All checks passed ✅**

### Content Quality Review
- ✅ Specification avoids technical implementation (no mention of Vue, Pinia, Supabase, etc.)
- ✅ Focuses on user value (profile creation time reduction from 30min to 5min)
- ✅ Written for stakeholders (plain language, business outcomes)
- ✅ All mandatory sections present and complete

### Requirement Quality Review
- ✅ Zero clarification markers (comprehensive documentation available)
- ✅ All 20 functional requirements are testable with clear MUST statements
- ✅ Success criteria use specific metrics (95% success rate, <1sec load time)
- ✅ Success criteria are technology-agnostic (user-facing outcomes only)

### Coverage Review
- ✅ 5 prioritized user stories covering Create, Read, Update, Export, Import operations
- ✅ Edge cases address concurrency, large datasets, corrupted data, network issues
- ✅ Dependencies clearly identify required database schema and RLS policies
- ✅ Out of scope clearly bounds feature to prevent scope creep

## Notes

- Feature is already implemented; this is retroactive documentation
- Specification accurately reflects existing implementation based on /docs
- Ready for `/speckit.plan` to generate technical implementation plan
- Can proceed to `/speckit.tasks` after plan generation
