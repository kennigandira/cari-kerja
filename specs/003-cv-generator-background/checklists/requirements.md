# Specification Quality Checklist: CV & Cover Letter Background Generator

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-08
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)
**Status**: ✅ PASSED

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**All checks passed ✅**

### Content Quality Review
- ✅ Specification avoids technical implementation (no mention of Vue, Cloudflare specifics, Hono, etc.)
- ✅ Focuses on user value (removing availability constraint, increasing applications/month)
- ✅ Written for stakeholders (business outcomes, time savings, async workflows)
- ✅ All mandatory sections present and complete

### Requirement Quality Review
- ✅ Zero clarification markers (comprehensive PRD/user stories available)
- ✅ All 20 functional requirements are testable with clear MUST statements
- ✅ Success criteria use specific metrics (95% success rate, <10min generation, 30% offline)
- ✅ Success criteria are technology-agnostic (user-facing outcomes like "queue in <3 seconds")

### Coverage Review
- ✅ 5 prioritized user stories covering Queue, Monitor, Download, Notify, Regenerate operations
- ✅ Edge cases address rate limits, PDF failures, timeouts, duplicates, queue overflow
- ✅ Dependencies clearly identify Master Profile, Kanban, Processing Queue, Workers, Storage
- ✅ Out of scope clearly bounds MVP (no multi-stage review, bulk ops, analytics, mobile apps)

## Notes

- New feature (not yet implemented) - spec guides future development
- Comprehensive documentation available in /docs/features/cv_generator/
- Ready for `/speckit.plan` to generate technical implementation plan
- Can proceed to `/speckit.tasks` after plan generation
